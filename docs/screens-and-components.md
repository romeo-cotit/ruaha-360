# Ruaha 360 — screens and components

Status: **specification, nothing built.**
Authority: Ruaha 360 Overview Plan v2 (S07, S08, S11, S12, S15).
Companion to `schema.md` — every data reference here is a real table, view or
column from the migrations. Nothing in this document invents a field.
Target: MVP demo, 30 September 2026.

## 0 · How to use this document

Written to be handed to an implementing agent alongside `schema.md` and the
`supabase/` migrations. Rules of engagement:

1. **Do not invent tables, columns, views or enum values.** If a screen seems
   to need one that does not exist, stop and raise it. The schema is
   deliberate; the gap is probably the point.
2. **RLS is the security boundary.** Route guards are convenience only. Never
   add a client-side check as a substitute for a policy, and never work around
   a policy that returns zero rows — that result is the specification.
3. **Do not add libraries** beyond the stack listed in §2. No chart library
   until the Tower renders real numbers. No state manager beyond TanStack
   Query. No ORM.
4. **Build tier by tier.** T1 first, all of it, before any T2. The T1 set is
   exactly the acceptance journey and nothing else.
5. **Validated against the cloud dev project.** The migrations are applied
   there and recorded; `pnpm db:rls` must pass before UI work that depends on
   a policy. There is no local Supabase (see `supabase/README.md`).

## 1 · Tiers

| tier | meaning |
|---|---|
| **T1** | Required for the acceptance journey to pass end to end. Build all of it first. |
| **T2** | Needed for the demo to feel complete. Build only after every T1 screen works. |
| **T3** | Post-demo. Do not build. |
| **cut** | Explicitly out of MVP. Do not build even if a reference screen shows it. |

**Working order: make it work → make it right → make it fast.**
T1 is "make it work". Validation depth, empty/error polish and accessibility
are "make it right". Visual design is deliberately last, with one exception
in §9.

---

## 2 · Stack (fixed)

```
Vite + React + TypeScript          SPA, no SSR
TanStack Router                    typed routes, search-param state, guards
TanStack Query                     all server state
Tailwind + shadcn/ui               UI primitives
TanStack Table                     ops tables and Tower drill-downs
react-hook-form + Zod              forms; Zod schemas shared with Edge Functions
react-i18next                      Swahili + English, JSON in repo
vite-plugin-pwa                    cached shell, opens offline
@supabase/supabase-js              the only data client
```

Generated database types are committed and imported. No hand-written row types.

## 3 · Route map

```
/login                         public
/select-role                   multi-membership picker
/no-access                     zero memberships

/farm                          _farmer  · mobile-first · Swahili
  /farm/my-farm
  /farm/equipment
  /farm/equipment/$equipmentId
  /farm/requests
  /farm/requests/$requestId
  /farm/opportunities

/officer                       _officer · mobile-first · bilingual
  /officer/register

  /ops/tower/market
```

One layout route per surface. `beforeLoad` reads the session's memberships and
redirects if the role does not match. The Tower lives **inside** `_ops` —
executive is an Ops view in MVP, not a fourth role.

---

## 4 · Shell

### 4.1 App shell — T1
- Role-aware nav. Farmer and Officer get a bottom tab bar; Ops gets a sidebar.
- Language switch, persisted to `app_user.locale`.
- **Demo banner**, always visible, driven by `VITE_DATA_MODE=demo`. Never by a
  database column — the demo instance and the live instance are different
  databases.
- Sign out.

### 4.2 `/login` — T1
- Email + password via `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword`.
- On success: query `membership` for `auth.uid()` where `revoked_at is null`.
  - 0 rows → `/no-access`
  - 1 row → that role's home
  - 2+ rows → `/select-role`
- **States:** idle · submitting · invalid credentials · network error.
- **Acceptance:** each of the six seeded accounts lands on the correct home.

### 4.3 `/select-role` — T1
- Lists memberships as role + project + village. Selection stored in memory
  and in the URL, not in a token.

### 4.4 `/no-access` — T1
- A real screen with a next step ("ask your programme manager to add you"),
  never a blank page or a crash.

---

## 5 · Officer surface

The origin of nearly all data. Mobile-first, bilingual, interrupted-save
tolerant.

### 5.1 `/officer` — home — T1
- **Data:** `village` (via `app_villages()`), counts from `person`, `farm`,
  `pue_request`.
- Assigned villages, unverified record count, primary action **Register**.
- **States:** loading · zero villages assigned · error.

### 5.2 `/officer/register` — T1 — the most important screen in the build
One page, one submit. Creates person + household + farm + plot + crop_cycle +
expected harvest_report together.

- **Writes via a single RPC** — `app_register_farmer` (specified in the
  business-rules document). **Not** five chained client inserts: a phone that
  loses signal mid-chain leaves orphan rows across five tables.
- **Sections**, all on one scrollable page:
  1. Person — `given_name`, `family_name`, `phone` (optional)
  2. Household — `label`, is this person the head
  3. Farm — `label`, GPS point (optional), link to household
  4. Plot — `label`, `area_ha`
  5. Crop cycle — crop, measure (branches on `crop.measured_by`),
     `planted_on`, `harvest_start`, `harvest_end`
  6. Expected harvest — `quantity_kg`, `confidence`
- Every section writes `source = 'field_verified'` and `captured_by` = current
  user. Provenance is never optional and never a user-facing choice here.
- **Draft persistence:** the whole form autosaves to IndexedDB keyed by a
  client-generated draft id. Restores on mount. Cleared only after the RPC
  returns success.
- **States:** empty · restoring draft · saving · **saved-locally-not-submitted**
  · submit failed with retry · success.
- **Acceptance:** kill the network mid-form, reload, the form comes back with
  every field intact and a visible "not yet submitted" badge.

### 5.3 `/officer/people` — T2
- `DataTable` over `person` scoped by RLS. Search by name, filter by
  `verification`.

### 5.4 `/officer/people/$personId` — T1
- Person detail: household members, farms, plots, cycles, provenance on each.
- **Verify** action → sets `verification = 'verified'`, `verified_by`,
  `verified_at`. Officer only.
- **Acceptance:** verifying flips the `ProvenanceBadge` on this screen and on
  the farmer's My Farm without a manual refresh (invalidate the query key).

### 5.5 `/officer/farms/$farmId` — T2
Plots list, add plot, GPS capture, farm-level provenance.

### 5.6 `/officer/cycles/$cycleId` — T2
Cycle detail plus harvest reports. Adding a new expected figure **supersedes**
the previous one: set the old row `is_current = false`, insert the new row
`is_current = true`. The partial unique index enforces this — handle the
constraint error, do not pre-check.

### 5.7 `/officer/verify` — T2
Queue of records where `verification in ('unverified','pending')` in the
officer's villages.

### 5.8 Visits — **T3**. Not in MVP.

---

## 6 · Farmer surface

Mobile-first, Swahili-first, low-end Android. Read-heavy. Keep this bundle
lean — it runs on the weakest hardware in the system.

### 6.1 `/farm` — home — T2
Status summary, latest request status, any opportunity the farmer's supply is
inside.

### 6.2 `/farm/my-farm` — T1
- **Data:** `farm` → `plot` → `crop_cycle` → `harvest_report` (current
  expected), all via `app_farms()` scoping.
- Read-only. Household, plots with area, crops with expected harvest.
- Every figure carries a `ProvenanceBadge`.
- **States:** loading · **no farm yet** (a real message, not an empty list) ·
  error.
- **Acceptance:** the farmer sees exactly her own farm. Seeded farmer Neema
  sees one farm and cannot reach Joseph's.

### 6.3 `/farm/equipment` — T1
- **Data:** `equipment` joined to `equipment_category`, scoped by
  `app_projects()`.
- Cards: name in the active language, `rated_power_kw`, `indicative_price` with
  currency, category.
- The word **indicative** appears next to every price. It is not a quotation.

### 6.4 `/farm/equipment/$equipmentId` — T1
- Detail plus **Request this** form: `quantity`, `hours_per_day`,
  `days_per_week` (prefilled from `typical_*`), `purpose`.
- Live `EnergyEstimatePanel` recalculating as the inputs change, labelled as an
  estimate.
- Submit inserts `pue_request` with `status = 'submitted'`.
- **Acceptance:** changing hours from 6 to 8 visibly changes the estimate
  before submit, and the stored `energy_estimate` row after submit matches.

### 6.5 `/farm/requests` and `/farm/requests/$requestId` — T1 / T2
- List with `StatusPill`. Detail shows the equipment, the assumptions, the
  stored estimate, and the decision note when decided.
- A submitted request is **not editable**. The trigger enforces it; the UI
  must not offer the control.

### 6.6 `/farm/opportunities` — T2
Opportunities where this farmer's supply is in `opportunity_supply`. Must state
plainly that an opportunity is not a sale.

### 6.7 Progress · Training · Services — **cut**.

---

## 7 · Ops surface

Desktop-first, English, table-heavy.

### 7.1 `/ops` — home — T2
Queue counts: requests awaiting review, open demands, unverified records.

### 7.2 `/ops/requests` — T1
- `DataTable` over `pue_request` with `equipment`, `person`, `energy_estimate`.
- Filter by `status` and village. **Filter state lives in the URL** as validated
  search params — that is why TanStack Router is in the stack.
- Columns: applicant · village · equipment · est. kW · status · submitted.

### 7.3 `/ops/requests/$requestId` — T1
- Full request, applicant, farm, the estimate with its snapshotted inputs, and
  village headroom from `v_village_energy`.
- **Actions:** Start review (`submitted → under_review`), Approve, Reject —
  both requiring a `decision_note`.
- The status machine is enforced by `pue_request_guard`. The UI offers only
  legal transitions and surfaces the trigger's error message verbatim if one
  is raised.
- **Acceptance:** approving updates the farmer's request view and moves
  `approved_peak_kw` in `v_village_energy`.

### 7.4 `/ops/catalogue` — T1 read / T2 edit
`equipment` list with power, typical hours, indicative price. Editing is T2 —
the seed provides the catalogue for the demo.

### 7.5 `/ops/buyers` — T2
Buyer list and create. `channel = 'afm'` is a label only; no integration.

### 7.6 `/ops/demand` — T1
List of `buyer_demand` plus a create form: buyer, crop, `quantity_kg`, window,
`delivery_point`, `indicative_price_per_kg`, `quality_note`.

### 7.7 `/ops/demand/$demandId` — T1
- **Data:** `v_demand_match` for this demand.
- Table of villages with `available_kg`, `coverable_kg`, `coverage_pct`, and
  whether an opportunity already exists.
- **Action:** create an opportunity for a village.
- **Acceptance:** the seeded maize demand shows Ilundo at 5,600 kg available
  and 62.2% coverage. The seeded coffee demand shows **zero matching supply**,
  and the screen says so rather than hiding the row.

### 7.8 `/ops/opportunities/$opportunityId` — T1
- Opportunity with its `opportunity_supply` lines: crop cycle, farmer, plot,
  contributed kg — each a `DrillLink` to the underlying record.
- **Action:** attach supply from `v_harvest_available` for that village, crop
  and window.
- The over-commitment error from `opportunity_supply_guard` is shown to the
  user as written. Do not pre-validate in the client and do not swallow it.
- **Acceptance:** attaching supply already committed elsewhere is refused with
  a readable message.

### 7.9 `/ops/villages` — T2
Village list, `village_capacity` with `basis` and `simultaneity_factor` shown
explicitly.

### 7.10 Translations admin · user admin — **cut.**
Translations are JSON in the repo. User admin is the Supabase dashboard.

---

## 8 · Control Tower

`/ops/tower`, inside the Ops surface. Built **last**, from connected records.

### 8.1 `/ops/tower` — overview — T1
Village selector, then five tiles:

| tile | source |
|---|---|
| Production — expected vs actual kg by crop | `v_village_production` |
| PUE pipeline — count and indicative value by status | `v_village_pue_pipeline` |
| Energy — capacity, prospective peak, approved peak, headroom | `v_village_energy` |
| Market — open demand vs available supply | `v_demand_match`, `v_village_supply` |
| Data quality — verified share, GPS coverage, cycles with estimates | `v_village_data_quality` |

**Non-negotiable labelling on this screen:**
- Capacity is shown with its `capacity_basis`. Never present a planned figure
  as measured.
- Prospective and approved demand are separate numbers, never summed into one
  "demand" figure. An application is not a load.
- `simultaneity_factor` is displayed next to the peak it was applied to.
- `cycle_area_ha` is labelled "planted area across cycles", never "land area" —
  intercropping means it can exceed the village's hectares.

### 8.2 Drill-downs — T1
`/ops/tower/production`, `/ops/tower/energy`, `/ops/tower/market`. Each is a
table that ends in a link to an actual row: a crop cycle, a request, an
opportunity's supply lines.

**Acceptance:** from any Tower headline, reach a single farmer's record in at
most three clicks. If a number cannot be traced, it does not belong on the
screen.

## 9 · Components

### 9.1 These carry the product's claim — build first

**`ProvenanceBadge`**
```ts
{ source: SourceType; verification: VerificationStatus;
  confidence?: ConfidenceLevel; capturedAt: string; capturedBy?: string }
```
One chip rendering all of it, with a tooltip giving the long form. Appears on
every record on every surface. The five source values get five distinct
treatments; verification gets its own state. This component is how the
"reported / verified / measured / estimated" discipline actually reaches users.

**`EnergyEstimatePanel`**
```ts
{ ratedPowerKw: number; quantity: number;
  hoursPerDay: number; daysPerWeek: number; editable?: boolean }
```
Shows the inputs, the arithmetic, and the outputs (`kW`, `kWh/day`,
`kWh/week`). When editable, recalculates live. Always labelled as an estimate.
Mirrors `energy_estimate`'s generated columns exactly — if the two ever
disagree, the component is wrong.

**`DrillLink` / `RecordDrawer`**
Turns any aggregate cell into a path to its rows. Used throughout the Tower.

**`CoverageBar`**
Demand against available supply, with the already-committed slice visible.

### 9.2 Forms

**`CropPicker` + `MeasureInput`** — branches on `crop.measured_by`:
`area` → hectares · `tree_count` → integer trees · `unit_count` → integer
units (hives). Switching crop switches the input. Bilingual labels from
`crop.name_en` / `crop.name_sw`. **This is harder than it looks — budget for it.**

**`AreaInput`** — always stores hectares; displays per
`country.default_area_unit`. Conversion happens at the edge, never in storage.

**`HarvestWindowPicker`** — start and end date, validating `end >= start`.

**`GpsCapture`** — one point. States: unsupported · permission denied ·
acquiring · acquired · manual entry fallback.

**`Field`** — react-hook-form + Zod + i18n label + error. Every input goes
through it.

### 9.3 Shell

`DataTable` (TanStack Table wrapper: sorting, URL-synced filters, empty state)
· `StatusPill` (request, demand, opportunity statuses) · `EmptyState` ·
`ErrorState` · `RequireRole` · `LanguageSwitch` · `DemoBanner` ·
`UnsavedDraftBadge` · `ConfirmDialog`.

### 9.4 Hooks

- `useSession()` — auth user, `app_user`, memberships, active role
- `useDraft(key)` — IndexedDB form persistence, returns
  `{ draft, save, clear, status }`
- `withProvenance(payload, source)` — injects `source`, `captured_by`,
  `captured_at` into every observed-table insert. **Write this on day one.**
  Retrofitting provenance into thirty call sites is a bad week.

---

## 10 · Conventions

**Query keys** — `['person', villageId]`, `['farm', farmId]`,
`['requests', { villageId, status }]`, `['tower','energy', villageId]`.
Mutations invalidate the narrowest key that covers the change.

**All writes go through a mutation helper** that applies `withProvenance` and
surfaces Postgres error messages verbatim. Trigger errors
(`pue_request_guard`, `opportunity_supply_guard`) are written to be read by
humans; do not replace them with a generic failure toast.

**Zero rows is a legitimate answer.** RLS returning nothing means "you may not
see this". Render an empty state, never an error, and never retry.

**i18n** — every user-facing string is a key. Farmer and Officer surfaces ship
complete Swahili. Ops and Tower may ship English-only for the demo. Reference
data (crops, equipment, categories) is translated **in the database**, not in
JSON — those rows are created at runtime.

**Numbers** — `tabular-nums` wherever figures align. Weights in kg, power in
kW, energy in kWh, area in ha, money with an explicit currency code.

---

## 11 · The acceptance journey

This is the Playwright test and the demo script. It is the definition of done
for T1.

1. Officer signs in → `/officer/register` → creates person, household, farm,
   plot, crop cycle, expected harvest in one submit
2. Officer opens the person → **verifies** the records
3. Farmer signs in → `/farm/my-farm` → sees the same records with provenance
4. Farmer opens `/farm/equipment` → picks the maize mill → sets hours → sees
   the estimate move → submits
5. Ops signs in → `/ops/requests` → opens it → starts review → approves
6. Ops opens `/ops/demand` → the maize demand → sees Ilundo coverage
7. Ops creates an opportunity → attaches supply lines
8. Ops opens `/ops/tower` → production, energy and market tiles reflect all of
   the above → drills from a headline to that farmer's record

Run against seeded demo data. Also test: permissions per role, and an
interrupted save in step 1.

## 12 · Do not build

Training · Services · Progress · translations admin · user admin · photo
upload · farm polygons · offline sync queues · notifications · meter screens ·
crowdfarming · wallets or QR payments · export or shipment tracking · buyer
self-service accounts · any AI surface · any chart library before the Tower
renders real numbers.

Reference screens from the Control Center and African Farmers Market decks show
several of these. **A screen existing does not put it in scope.**

---

## 13 · The one design decision that cannot wait

Set the brand tokens in the Tailwind theme **before** adding shadcn components:

```
primary   #1d70b7      accent    #93c01f
deep      #0C1F5B      surface   #F5F3E5
font      Poppins
```

shadcn ships slate/zinc defaults and inherits from the theme at add-time.
Twenty minutes now against repainting forty components later. This is not
"make it beautiful" — it is avoiding a repaint.

Everything else visual waits until the journey passes.

---

## 14 · Open

- Swahili copy does not exist yet. Field labels and validation messages need a
  native reviewer before the demo, not a machine translation pass.
- Officer device assumptions untested — no coverage or handset survey has been
  done (research item D).
- Confidence is `low/medium/high` provisionally (S22).
- `season_label` is free text until a season taxonomy is agreed (S22).
