# Swahili handover — Ruaha 360

Generated 2026-09-29 from `src/i18n/en/common.json`. Do not edit by hand;
regenerate with `pnpm i18n:handover`.

## What this is

Every user-facing string in the application, with its Swahili **draft**,
for a **native Kiswahili reviewer** to correct. The string list is frozen:
every screen is built, so the keys will not move while the work is under
way.

**The Swahili here is an unreviewed draft.** It was written by Claude from
a sourced glossary (`docs/i18n-glossary.md`) and back-translated blind as a
cross-check. That catches some errors and not others, and a native reader
has not seen it. It ships so the demo is usable in Swahili, with the
status column recording honestly which strings a native reviewer has been
through. Where a draft is wrong, correct it: a wrong Swahili string is
worse than English, because English is visibly untranslated and a wrong
string is not.

## Priority

- **Required** — the farmer and officer surfaces, and the chrome both of
  them render. 711 strings. CLAUDE.md specifies these ship
  complete Swahili.
- **Optional** — Ops and Tower. 493 strings. These may ship
  English for the demo.

1204 strings in total: 2 reviewed, 1202 draft, 0 missing. 336 flagged for a closer look (see the Flag note).

## How to read the table

- **Status** is `draft` until a native reviewer has been through the
  string, `reviewed` once they have, and `missing` if there is no Swahili
  yet.
- `{{value}}` and its siblings are placeholders. They must appear in the
  translation exactly as written, or the string will render broken.
- The Notes column carries product requirements from CLAUDE.md, not style
  advice. "Estimate", "indicative" and "planned capacity" are claims about
  what the programme does and does not promise; a translation that
  strengthens them misrepresents it.
- A survey incentive is a fixed cash amount paid at the office. It is never
  earnings, a wallet, a balance or a payment.
- Terms marked `unverified` in `docs/i18n-glossary.md` had no Tanzanian
  source. Check those first.
- Flag anything whose meaning is unclear rather than guessing. A gap is a
  question; a wrong string is a defect nobody sees.

## Required — farmer and officer surfaces

| Key | English | Swahili | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a11y.breadcrumb` | Breadcrumb | Njia ya kurasa | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Njia ya kurasa' composed; no glossary term for breadcrumb (screen-reader label only). |
| `a11y.language` | Language | Lugha | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Lugha' unverified as UI label. |
| `a11y.primaryNav` | Primary navigation | Urambazaji mkuu | draft |  |
| `a11y.skipToContent` | Skip to content | Ruka hadi kwenye maudhui | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Ruka hadi kwenye maudhui' composed; 'Ruka' unverified. |
| `auditTrail.blocked` | Could not redeem: {{reason}} | Haikuweza kukabidhiwa: {{reason}} | draft | Keep {{reason}} Flag: Drafter: 'Could not redeem' -> 'Haikuweza kukabidhiwa' (redeem = kabidhi, glossary UNVERIFIED). Subject concord assumes 'vocha/motisha' unspecified; may need adjusting. |
| `auditTrail.empty` | Nothing recorded yet. | Bado hakuna kilichorekodiwa. | draft |  |
| `auditTrail.heldForAudit` | Held for an in-person audit | Imeshikiliwa kwa ukaguzi wa ana kwa ana | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'in-person audit' -> 'ukaguzi wa ana kwa ana' (composed; 'ukaguzi' UNVERIFIED). |
| `auditTrail.idSeen` | ID checked: {{type}} | Kitambulisho kilichokaguliwa: {{type}} | draft | Keep {{type}} |
| `auditTrail.idType.driving_licence` | Driving licence | Leseni ya udereva | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Leseni ya udereva' UNVERIFIED in glossary. |
| `auditTrail.idType.nida` | NIDA card | Kitambulisho cha Taifa (NIDA) | draft |  |
| `auditTrail.idType.village_letter` | Village letter | Barua ya kijiji | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Barua ya kijiji' is a composed name for the ID-substitute document; exact Tanzanian name unknown. |
| `auditTrail.idType.voter` | Voter card | Kadi ya mpiga kura | draft |  |
| `auditTrail.kind.answered` | Survey answered | Dodoso limejibiwa | draft |  |
| `auditTrail.kind.household_registered` | Household registered | Kaya imesajiliwa | draft |  |
| `auditTrail.kind.household_verified` | Household verified | Kaya imehakikiwa | draft |  |
| `auditTrail.kind.issued` | Voucher issued | Vocha imetolewa | draft |  |
| `auditTrail.kind.login_initial` | App login created | Akaunti ya programu imeundwa | draft |  |
| `auditTrail.kind.login_reset` | App password reset | Neno la siri la programu limerudishwa | draft |  |
| `auditTrail.kind.redeemed` | Incentive handed over | Motisha imekabidhiwa | draft |  |
| `auditTrail.kind.refused` | Scan refused | Skani imekataliwa | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Scan refused' -> 'Skani imekataliwa'; glossary suggests 'imezuiwa' for policy blocks. Chose imekataliwa to match 'refused'. |
| `auditTrail.kind.scanned` | Voucher scanned | Vocha imeskaniwa | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'imeskaniwa' passive of loan 'skani'; unattested. |
| `auditTrail.kind.survey_published` | Survey published | Dodoso limechapishwa | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'published' -> 'limechapishwa'; 'kuchapisha' is print/publish, may read as printed. Alternative 'limetolewa'. Cross-check (natural): 'limechapishwa' back-translates as 'printed/issued'; for a survey made live in the app it may read as printed on paper (drafter also flagged). |
| `auditTrail.kind.voided` | Voucher cancelled | Vocha imeghairiwa | draft |  |
| `auditTrail.reason` | Reason: {{reason}} | Sababu: {{reason}} | draft | Keep {{reason}} |
| `auditTrail.role.admin` | Admin | Msimamizi | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Msimamizi' (glossary UNVERIFIED). |
| `auditTrail.role.farmer` | Farmer | Mkulima | draft |  |
| `auditTrail.role.field_officer` | Field officer | Afisa wa uwandani | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Afisa wa uwandani' per glossary decision (composed, unverified). |
| `auditTrail.role.ops` | Ops | Uendeshaji | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Ops' role -> 'Uendeshaji' (glossary UNVERIFIED, means 'operations'). |
| `auditTrail.role.unknown` | Unknown role | Jukumu halijulikani | draft |  |
| `auditTrail.title` | Audit trail | Kumbukumbu za ukaguzi | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Audit trail' = 'Kumbukumbu za ukaguzi' (glossary UNVERIFIED). Cross-check (natural): 'Kumbukumbu za ukaguzi' back-translates as 'audit records (records of checking)'; it reads as a list of inspections rather than a who-did-what trail. Glossary-locked, so only for the native reviewer. |
| `capacityBasis.nameplate` | Nameplate | Kibao cha mashine | draft | Capacity is PLANNED or NAMEPLATE, never measured. Always shown with its basis. Flag: Drafter: 'Kibao cha mashine' (machine plate) is a short label; glossary only has a long unverified phrase. Must stay distinct from 'Uliopangwa' and never read as measured. Cross-check (meaning): 'Kibao cha mashine' (back: 'Machine plate') names the object, not a rated/nameplate figure, and 'kibao' alone can mean signboard or tablet; it may not read as a stated rating that is not measured. Native/energy reviewer should confirm. |
| `capacityBasis.planned` | Planned | Uliopangwa | draft | Capacity is PLANNED or NAMEPLATE, never measured. Always shown with its basis. Flag: Drafter: 'Uliopangwa' agrees with 'uwezo' (capacity), since this label sits next to a capacity figure. May need a different class agreement if used beside another noun. |
| `common.back` | Back | Rudi nyuma | draft |  |
| `common.close` | Close | Funga | draft |  |
| `common.loading` | Loading… | Inapakia… | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Inapakia…' unverified per glossary. |
| `common.no` | No | Hapana | draft |  |
| `common.optional` | optional | si lazima | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'si lazima' unverified per glossary (alt 'hiari'). |
| `common.yes` | Yes | Ndiyo | draft |  |
| `confidence.high` | High | Juu | draft | Confidence level recorded with a figure. Low / medium / high. |
| `confidence.low` | Low | Chini | draft | Confidence level recorded with a figure. Low / medium / high. Flag: Drafter: 'Chini/Wastani/Juu' scale words not attested for confidence. |
| `confidence.medium` | Medium | Wastani | draft | Confidence level recorded with a figure. Low / medium / high. |
| `cycleDetail.harvests` | Harvest figures | Kiasi cha mavuno | draft |  |
| `cycleDetail.measure` | Planted | Kiasi kilichopandwa | draft | Flag: Drafter: Label 'Planted' whose value is area, tree count or unit count; 'Kilichopandwa' composed. Cross-check (meaning): "Kilichopandwa" reads as "What was planted", which a farmer may take to mean the crop name, but the value is a quantity (area, trees or units). |
| `cycleDetail.noHarvestsDetail` | Nobody has recorded an expected or actual figure for this cycle. | Hakuna aliyerekodi kiasi kinachotarajiwa wala halisi kwa msimu huu wa zao. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'cycle' = 'msimu wa zao' (glossary UNVERIFIED). |
| `cycleDetail.noHarvestsTitle` | No harvest figure yet | Bado hakuna kiasi cha mavuno | draft |  |
| `cycleDetail.notFoundDetail` | It may not exist, or it may be outside your villages. | Huenda haupo, au uko nje ya vijiji vyako. | draft |  |
| `cycleDetail.notFoundTitle` | Crop cycle not found | Msimu wa zao haukupatikana | draft |  |
| `cycleDetail.season` | Season | Msimu | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Season' = 'Msimu'; free-text value from officer, taxonomy open (S22). |
| `cycleDetail.seriesNote` | A harvest figure is a series. A revised estimate does not erase the one it replaced. | Kiasi cha mavuno ni mfululizo wa rekodi. Makadirio yaliyorekebishwa hayafuti yale ya awali. | draft |  |
| `cycleDetail.status` | Status | Hali | draft |  |
| `cycleDetail.superseded` | superseded | imebadilishwa na mpya | draft | Flag: Replaced after the cross-check. Meaning: this figure was replaced by a newer one and is excluded from totals. Drafter: 'imepitwa na mpya' (overtaken by a newer one) is my composition; agreement varies with the noun. Cross-check (meaning): "imepitwa na mpya" was read as "overtaken by a new one"; it does not clearly say the figure was replaced and is excluded from totals (superseded), and the agreement is fixed to one noun class. |
| `cycleDetail.trees_one` | 1 tree | mti 1 | draft |  |
| `cycleDetail.trees_other` | {{count}} trees | miti {{count}} | draft | Keep {{count}} |
| `cycleDetail.units_one` | 1 unit | kitengo 1 | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Unit' as a crop count (not equipment) rendered 'kitengo'/'vitengo'; unsure what the unit is (e.g. hives, beds). Also unused in source. |
| `cycleDetail.units_other` | {{count}} units | vitengo {{count}} | draft | Keep {{count}} |
| `cycleDetail.window` | Harvest window | Kipindi cha kuvuna | draft |  |
| `cycleStatus.abandoned` | Abandoned | Imeachwa | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Imeachwa' for Abandoned cycle; plain word, not in glossary. |
| `cycleStatus.growing` | Growing | Inakua | draft |  |
| `cycleStatus.harvested` | Harvested | Imevunwa | draft |  |
| `cycleStatus.planned` | Planned | Imepangwa | draft |  |
| `dbError.addPhoneFirst` | Add a phone number before issuing a login. | Ongeza namba ya simu kabla ya kutoa akaunti ya kuingia. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Login' (issuing a login) rendered 'akaunti ya kuingia' (composed); consistent across personHasLogin, phoneHasLogin. Glossary has 'kadi ya kuingia' for the printed card. |
| `dbError.choosePasswordFirst` | Choose a new password first. | Chagua neno la siri jipya kwanza. | draft |  |
| `dbError.confirmIdName` | Confirm that the name on the ID matches the household. | Thibitisha kwamba jina kwenye kitambulisho linalingana na kaya. | draft |  |
| `dbError.cropNeedsArea` | This crop is measured by area, so the planted area is required. | Zao hili hupimwa kwa eneo, kwa hiyo eneo lililopandwa linahitajika. | draft |  |
| `dbError.cropNeedsTrees` | This crop is measured by tree count, so the number of trees is required. | Zao hili hupimwa kwa idadi ya miti, kwa hiyo idadi ya miti inahitajika. | draft |  |
| `dbError.cropNeedsUnits` | This crop is measured by unit count, so the number of units is required. | Zao hili hupimwa kwa idadi ya vitengo, kwa hiyo idadi ya vitengo inahitajika. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Unit count' rendered 'idadi ya vitengo' (composed). |
| `dbError.farmLocationRequired` | The farm location is required: capture the GPS position before saving. | Mahali shamba lilipo panahitajika: rekodi mahali kwa kutumia GPS kabla ya kuhifadhi. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Capture the GPS position' rendered 'chukua nafasi ya GPS' (composed; 'nafasi' = position/space). Reviewer to check. |
| `dbError.householdNeedsChecking` | Your household record needs checking by an officer. | Rekodi ya kaya yako inahitaji kukaguliwa na afisa. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Checking' rendered 'kukaguliwa' (not 'kuhakikiwa') to keep it distinct from formal verification; reviewer may prefer hakiki. |
| `dbError.householdNeedsSecondVerifier` | Your household must be verified by a second staff member. | Kaya yako lazima ihakikiwe na mfanyakazi wa pili. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Staff member' rendered 'mfanyakazi' (not in glossary). Also used in voucher and staffPasswordNotHere strings. |
| `dbError.householdNotVerified` | Your household has not been verified yet. | Kaya yako bado haijahakikiwa. | draft |  |
| `dbError.notAwaitingVerification` | That record is not awaiting verification. | Rekodi hiyo haisubiri kuhakikiwa. | draft |  |
| `dbError.notLinkedToFarmer` | Your account is not linked to a registered farmer. | Akaunti yako haijaunganishwa na mkulima aliyesajiliwa. | draft |  |
| `dbError.personNotFound` | That person was not found, or is outside your villages. | Mtu huyo hakupatikana, au yuko nje ya vijiji vyako. | draft |  |
| `dbError.phoneFormat` | The phone number must be a Tanzanian mobile number, for example +255 712 345 678. | Namba ya simu lazima iwe namba ya simu ya mkononi ya Tanzania, kwa mfano +255 712 345 678. | draft |  |

| `dbError.questionChooseSome` | Question {{position}}: choose from the listed options. | Swali {{position}}: chagua kutoka kwenye chaguo zilizoorodheshwa. | draft | Keep {{position}} |
| `dbError.questionEnterNumber` | Question {{position}}: enter a number. | Swali {{position}}: andika namba. | draft | Keep {{position}} |
| `dbError.questionRequired` | Question {{position}} is required. | Swali {{position}} ni lazima. | draft | Keep {{position}} |
| `dbError.questionTooLong` | Question {{position}}: answer in at most 2000 characters. | Swali {{position}}: jibu lisizidi herufi 2000. | draft | Keep {{position}} |
| `dbError.questionYesNo` | Question {{position}}: answer yes or no. | Swali {{position}}: jibu ndiyo au hapana. | draft | Keep {{position}} |
| `dbError.recordIdDocument` | Record which ID document you checked. | Andika aina ya kitambulisho ulichokagua. | draft |  |
| `dbError.recordNotFound` | That record was not found, or it is outside your villages. | Rekodi hiyo haikupatikana, au iko nje ya vijiji vyako. | draft |  |
| `dbError.redeemOwnHousehold` | You cannot redeem a voucher for your own household. | Huwezi kukabidhi vocha ya kaya yako mwenyewe. | draft |  |
| `dbError.redeemOwnRegistration` | You registered this household, so another staff member must redeem this voucher. | Ulisajili kaya hii, kwa hiyo mfanyakazi mwingine lazima akabidhi vocha hii. | draft |  |
| `dbError.redeemOwnVerification` | You verified this household, so another staff member must redeem this voucher. | Ulihakiki kaya hii, kwa hiyo mfanyakazi mwingine lazima akabidhi vocha hii. | draft |  |
| `dbError.setOwnPasswordFirst` | Set your own password before answering surveys. | Weka neno la siri lako mwenyewe kabla ya kujibu madodoso. | draft |  |
| `dbError.signInFirst` | Sign in first. | Ingia kwanza. | draft |  |
| `dbError.staffPasswordNotHere` | This person signs in as staff, so their password cannot be reset here. | Mtu huyu huingia kama mfanyakazi, kwa hiyo neno lake la siri haliwezi kurudishwa hapa. | draft | Flag: Cross-check (natural): 'kurudishwa' alone reads as 'returned', not 'reset' (back-translation lost 'reset'); follows the glossary 'Rudisha neno la siri' but is ambiguous in a sentence. |
| `dbError.surveyClosed` | This survey is closed. | Dodoso hili limefungwa. | draft |  |
| `dbError.surveyLimitReached` | This survey has reached its limit. | Dodoso hili limefikia kikomo chake. | draft |  |
| `dbError.surveyNotFound` | This survey could not be found. | Dodoso hili halikupatikana. | draft |  |
| `dbError.surveyNotInVillage` | This survey is not open in your village. | Dodoso hili halijafunguliwa katika kijiji chako. | draft |  |
| `dbError.surveyOpenedBeforeRegistration` | This survey opened before your household was registered. | Dodoso hili lilifunguliwa kabla kaya yako haijasajiliwa. | draft |  |
| `dbError.verifyOtherOfficer` | A household must be verified by someone other than the officer who registered it. | Kaya lazima ihakikiwe na mtu mwingine, si afisa aliyeisajili. | draft |  |
| `dbError.voucherAlreadyRedeemed` | This voucher was already redeemed on {{date}} by {{name}}. | Motisha ya vocha hii ilishakabidhiwa tarehe {{date}} na {{name}}. | draft | Keep {{date}} {{name}} Flag: Drafter: 'Redeemed' rendered 'imekabidhiwa' (handed over) for officer-facing errors; farmer-facing status elsewhere is 'imechukuliwa'. Confirm which wording the reviewer wants across the app. Applies also to ...ByOther, redeemOwn*, voucherHeldForAudit. Cross-check (meaning): 'Redeemed' is rendered 'kabidhiwa' (handed over), so the back-translation reads as the voucher itself being handed over rather than redeemed for cash; the same verb is used for ByOther, redeemOwnRegistration, redeemOwnVerification, redeemOwnHousehold, voucherHeldForAudit and tour.officer.redeemBody, and differs from the farmer-facing 'imechukuliwa'. |
| `dbError.voucherAlreadyRedeemedByOther` | This voucher was already redeemed on {{date}} by another staff member. | Motisha ya vocha hii ilishakabidhiwa tarehe {{date}} na mfanyakazi mwingine. | draft | Keep {{date}} Flag: Changed after the cross-check; unreviewed. |
| `dbError.voucherExpired` | This voucher expired on {{date}}. | Vocha hii iliisha muda wake tarehe {{date}}. | draft | Keep {{date}} Flag: Drafter: 'iliisha muda wake' from glossary 'imeisha muda wake' [UNVERIFIED]. |

| `dbError.voucherNotFound` | Voucher not found. | Vocha haikupatikana. | draft |  |
| `dbError.voucherVoided` | This voucher was voided: {{reason}} | Vocha hii imebatilishwa: {{reason}} | draft | Keep {{reason}} Flag: Drafter: 'Voided' rendered 'imebatilishwa' (cancelled/annulled); not in glossary. |
| `demoBanner.detail` | Every figure here is invented. Nothing is a measured Ruaha result. | Kila takwimu hapa ni ya kubuni. Hakuna hata moja ambayo ni matokeo yaliyopimwa ya Ruaha. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Reworded to 'takwimu ... ya kubuni' (invented figures); native check that 'ya kubuni' reads as fictitious and not 'creative'. 'Si matokeo yaliyopimwa' keeps the not-measured meaning. |
| `demoBanner.label` | Demo data | Taarifa za majaribio | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Taarifa za majaribio' unverified per glossary. |
| `draft.earlierVersionSaved` | An earlier version of this form was already saved. Open it from the list to check it. | Toleo la awali la fomu hii lilishahifadhiwa. Lifungue kutoka kwenye orodha ili kulikagua. | draft | Flag: Changed after the cross-check; unreviewed. |
| `draft.notSubmitted` | Not yet submitted | Haijawasilishwa bado | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Haijawasilishwa bado' from glossary, unsourced. |
| `draft.storageError` | Could not save this draft on this device. Keep this page open until you submit. | Rasimu hii haikuweza kuhifadhiwa kwenye kifaa hiki. Acha ukurasa huu wazi hadi uwasilishe. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Rasimu' (draft) and 'kifaa' (device) ; 'Acha ukurasa huu wazi' for 'Keep this page open' composed. |
| `empty.noAccessDetail` | You may not have access to these records, or there are none yet. | Huenda huna ruhusa ya kuona rekodi hizi, au bado hakuna. | draft |  |
| `empty.noAccessToThis` | Nothing to show | Hakuna cha kuonyesha | draft |  |
| `equipment.days` | Days per week | Siku kwa wiki | draft |  |
| `equipment.daysDecimals` | Use at most 1 decimal place. | Tumia desimali isiyozidi 1. | draft |  |
| `equipment.daysRange` | Days per week run from 0 to 7. | Siku kwa wiki ni kuanzia 0 hadi 7. | draft |  |
| `equipment.estimateBlockedDetail` | Fill in how many, hours per day and days per week, and the estimate appears here. | Jaza idadi, saa kwa siku na siku kwa wiki, na makadirio yataonekana hapa. | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |
| `equipment.estimateBlockedTitle` | No estimate yet | Bado hakuna makadirio | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |
| `equipment.estimateImpossibleDetail` | One of the figures above is outside what is possible, so no estimate is shown for it. Correct it and the estimate returns. | Moja ya namba zilizo hapo juu iko nje ya kinachowezekana, kwa hiyo hakuna makadirio yanayoonyeshwa kwake. Irekebishe, na makadirio yatarudi. | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. Flag: Drafter: Idiom 'nje ya kinachowezekana' for 'outside what is possible' is composed; check naturalness. |
| `equipment.estimateImpossibleTitle` | This cannot be estimated | Hili haliwezi kukadiriwa | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |
| `equipment.hours` | Hours per day | Saa kwa siku | draft |  |
| `equipment.hoursDecimals` | Use at most 2 decimal places. | Tumia desimali zisizozidi 2. | draft |  |
| `equipment.hoursRange` | Hours per day run from 0 to 24. | Saa kwa siku ni kuanzia 0 hadi 24. | draft |  |
| `equipment.indicative` | Indicative | Ya makadirio | draft | Prices are INDICATIVE, never quotations. Must not read as a firm offer. |
| `equipment.indicativePrice` | Indicative price | Bei ya makadirio | draft | Prices are INDICATIVE, never quotations. Must not read as a firm offer. |
| `equipment.intro` | Powered equipment available through the programme. | Vifaa vya umeme vinavyopatikana kupitia mradi. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Programme' = 'programu' also means 'app' in Tanzanian Swahili; reviewer to choose 'mpango' or 'programu'. Also 'powered equipment' = 'vifaa vya umeme' (assumed electric). Cross-check (natural): "programu" also means "app" in Tanzanian Swahili (the back-translator flagged both readings), and "vifaa vya umeme" narrows "powered equipment" to electric. The same applies to "programu" in equipment.noneDetail. |
| `equipment.moreThanZero` | This must be more than zero. | Hii lazima iwe zaidi ya sifuri. | draft |  |
| `equipment.noneDetail` | Equipment appears here once the programme adds it. | Vifaa vitaonekana hapa mradi utakapoviongeza. | draft | Flag: Cross-check (natural): "programu itakapoviongeza" can read as "when the app adds them". |
| `equipment.noneTitle` | No equipment listed yet | Bado hakuna vifaa vilivyoorodheshwa | draft |  |
| `equipment.notANumber` | Enter a number. | Weka namba. | draft |  |
| `equipment.notAQuotation` | Prices are indicative, not quotations. | Bei ni ya makadirio, si nukuu ya bei. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Kept 'si nukuu ya bei' per glossary; 'Bei ni ya makadirio' number agreement is generic. |
| `equipment.notFoundDetail` | It may no longer be listed, or you may not have access to it. | Huenda hakiorodheshwi tena, au huna ruhusa ya kukifikia. | draft |  |
| `equipment.notFoundTitle` | Equipment not found | Kifaa hakikupatikana | draft |  |
| `equipment.price` | Price | Bei ya makadirio | draft | Prices are INDICATIVE, never quotations. Must not read as a firm offer. Flag: Drafter: Labelled 'Bei ya makadirio' (glossary decision) because the note requires indicative wording; English label is just 'Price'. |
| `equipment.purpose` | What will you use it for? | Utakitumia kwa ajili ya nini? | draft | Flag: Drafter: Assumes equipment noun class 7 ('kifaa' -> 'Utakitumia'). |
| `equipment.quantity` | How many | Idadi | draft |  |
| `equipment.ratedPower` | Rated power | Nguvu iliyoandikwa | draft | Flag: Cross-check (glossary): Same as estimate.ratedPower: shortened nameplate term "nguvu iliyoandikwa" is ambiguous, and "iliyoandikwa iliyorekodiwa" in requests.noEstimateDetail is clumsy. |
| `equipment.requestThis` | Request this | Omba kifaa hiki | draft |  |
| `equipment.required` | This is required. | Ni lazima. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Ni lazima.' short form; the English 'This is required.' has no clear subject. |
| `equipment.submit` | Submit request | Wasilisha ombi | draft | Flag: Drafter: Submit vs send: 'Wasilisha ombi' here (matches status 'Imewasilishwa') but 'Tuma ombi hili' for requests.action.submit and 'haijatumwa' in draftNote, following glossary Tuma=send. Reviewer to unify. |
| `equipment.submitting` | Submitting… | Inawasilisha… | draft |  |
| `equipment.successDetail` | Ops will review it. You can follow it under Requests. | Timu ya uendeshaji italipitia. Unaweza kulifuatilia chini ya Maombi. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Ops' rendered 'Timu ya uendeshaji' (glossary 'Uendeshaji' role UNVERIFIED). |
| `equipment.successTitle` | Request submitted | Ombi limewasilishwa | draft |  |
| `equipment.title` | Equipment | Vifaa | draft |  |
| `equipment.viewRequest` | View the request | Tazama ombi | draft |  |
| `equipment.wholeNumber` | Enter a whole number. | Weka namba nzima. | draft |  |
| `error.accountUnreadable` | Your account could not be read. Try again. | Akaunti yako haikuweza kusomwa. Jaribu tena. | draft |  |
| `error.badId` | That record reference is not valid. | Rejea ya rekodi hiyo si sahihi. | draft |  |
| `error.badReference` | That refers to a record that does not exist. | Hiyo inarejelea rekodi ambayo haipo. | draft |  |
| `error.contributionPositive` | A contribution must be more than zero. | Kiasi kinachochangiwa lazima kiwe zaidi ya sifuri. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Contribution' (quantity attached from a harvest figure to an opportunity) rendered 'kiasi kinachochangiwa' (composed). |
| `error.daysRange` | Days per week must be between 0 and 7. | Siku kwa wiki lazima ziwe kati ya 0 na 7. | draft |  |
| `error.duplicate` | That record already exists. | Rekodi hiyo tayari ipo. | draft |  |
| `error.duplicateBuyer` | A buyer with that name already exists in this project. | Mnunuzi mwenye jina hilo tayari yupo katika mradi huu. | draft |  |

| `error.invalidValue` | One of the values is not allowed here. Check the form and try again. | Moja ya thamani haikubaliki hapa. Angalia fomu kisha ujaribu tena. | draft |  |
| `error.missingValue` | A required value is missing. | Thamani inayohitajika haipo. | draft |  |

| `error.notAllowed` | You do not have permission to do that. | Huna ruhusa ya kufanya hivyo. | draft |  |
| `error.numericOverflow` | One of the numbers is too large for the field it was typed into. Check the figures and try again. | Moja ya namba ni kubwa mno kwa kisanduku ulichoiandikia. Angalia namba kisha ujaribu tena. | draft |  |
| `error.oneCurrentHarvest` | A crop cycle can only have one current harvest figure. Supersede the existing one instead. | Msimu wa zao unaweza kuwa na kiasi kimoja tu cha sasa cha mavuno. Badala yake, weka kiasi kipya kuchukua nafasi ya kilichopo. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Supersede' rendered 'chukua nafasi ya kilichopo kwa kiasi kipya' (replace the existing with a new figure); no glossary term. |
| `error.personHasLogin` | This person already has an app login. | Mtu huyu tayari ana akaunti ya kuingia kwenye programu. | draft |  |

| `error.surveyAlreadyAnswered` | Your household has already answered this survey. | Kaya yako tayari imejibu dodoso hili. | draft |  |
| `error.title` | Something went wrong | Kuna tatizo | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Kuna tatizo' [UNVERIFIED glossary term]; 'error.retry' uses 'Jaribu tena' [UNVERIFIED]. |
| `error.unexpected` | Something went wrong that should not have. Try again, and tell the programme team if it keeps happening. | Kumetokea hitilafu isiyotarajiwa. Jaribu tena, na uiambie timu ya mradi ikiendelea kutokea. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Programme team' rendered 'timu ya programu'; sentence composed [UNVERIFIED like 'Kuna tatizo' glossary row]. |
| `error.windowBackwards` | The window must end on or after it starts. | Kipindi lazima kiishe siku ile ile kinapoanza au baada yake. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Window' rendered 'kipindi' (glossary: harvest window = kipindi cha kuvuna); the error does not say which kind of window, so check context. |
| `estimate.aDay` | a day | kwa siku | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |
| `estimate.aWeek` | a week | kwa wiki | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |
| `estimate.basis` | Calculated from rated power and the operating assumptions below (Level 1). | Imekokotolewa kutokana na nguvu iliyoandikwa na dhana za matumizi zilizo hapa chini (Kiwango cha 1). | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. Flag: Drafter: 'operating assumptions' = 'dhana za matumizi', 'Level 1' = 'Kiwango cha 1'; both composed. 'Rated power' = 'nguvu iliyoandikwa' (nameplate, glossary UNVERIFIED). |
| `estimate.days` | Days per week | Siku kwa wiki | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |
| `estimate.daysAWeek` | days a week | siku kwa wiki | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |

| `estimate.hoursADay` | hours a day | saa kwa siku | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |
| `estimate.isEstimate` | This is an estimate, not a measurement. | Haya ni makadirio, si kipimo. | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |
| `estimate.peak` | Estimated peak | Kilele kilichokadiriwa | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. Flag: Drafter: 'Kilele kilichokadiriwa' composed (glossary UNVERIFIED); estimate.peakNote uses 'nguvu ya juu zaidi' for peak power, also UNVERIFIED. |
| `estimate.peakNote` | Peak power does not change with hours of use. | Nguvu ya juu zaidi haibadiliki kulingana na saa za matumizi. | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |
| `estimate.perDay` | Estimated per day | Makadirio kwa siku | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |
| `estimate.perWeek` | Estimated per week | Makadirio kwa wiki | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |
| `estimate.quantity` | Quantity | Idadi | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |
| `estimate.rated` | rated | iliyoandikwa | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. Flag: Drafter: Appears as a unit label after a kW figure ('15 kW iliyoandikwa'); glossary nameplate wording shortened. Needs energy reviewer. |
| `estimate.ratedPower` | Rated power | Nguvu iliyoandikwa | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. Flag: Cross-check (glossary): The glossary nameplate wording "nguvu iliyoandikwa kwenye kibao cha mashine" was cut to "nguvu iliyoandikwa", which the blind translator read as "written-down (rated) power" and which loses the idea of the manufacturer rating on the equipment. The same short form is used in estimate.basis and estimate.rated. |
| `estimate.tag` | Estimate | Makadirio | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |
| `estimate.title` | Energy estimate | Makadirio ya nishati | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |
| `estimate.units_one` | unit | kifaa | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. Flag: Drafter: Unit noun for equipment items ('kifaa'/'vifaa'). Unused in source (usedIn empty); appears after a number in the equation. |

| `farmDetail.gps` | GPS point | Alama ya GPS | draft |  |
| `farmDetail.noGps` | Not captured | Haijarekodiwa | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Haijachukuliwa' (not captured); could read as 'not taken'. Alternative 'Haijarekodiwa'. |
| `farmDetail.noPlotsDetail` | This farm has no plots yet. | Shamba hili bado halina vipande vya shamba. | draft |  |
| `farmDetail.noPlotsTitle` | No plots recorded | Hakuna kipande cha shamba kilichorekodiwa | draft |  |

| `farmerLogin.cancel` | Cancel | Ghairi | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Ghairi' is UNVERIFIED in glossary; also used in voucherStatus.void 'Imeghairiwa' and voucher.voided/auditTrail.kind.voided. |
| `farmerLogin.detail` | Give these to the farmer. They sign in with their phone number and must choose their own password straight away. | Mpe mkulima taarifa hizi. Ataingia kwa namba yake ya simu na lazima achague neno lake la siri papo hapo. | draft | Flag: Changed after the cross-check; unreviewed. |
| `farmerLogin.done` | Done | Maliza | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Done' button rendered 'Maliza' (glossary UNVERIFIED). |
| `farmerLogin.failed` | The farmer is registered, but the app login could not be created. | Mkulima amesajiliwa, lakini akaunti ya programu haikuweza kuundwa. | draft |  |
| `farmerLogin.historyInitial` | Login created by {{name}} | Akaunti iliundwa na {{name}} | draft | Keep {{name}} |

| `farmerLogin.reset` | Reset app password | Rudisha neno la siri la programu | draft |  |
| `farmerLogin.resetConfirm` | Reset password | Rudisha neno la siri | draft |  |
| `farmerLogin.resetConfirmDetail` | Their current password stops working and anyone signed in with it is signed out. You will get a new temporary password to give them. | Neno lake la siri la sasa litaacha kufanya kazi, na yeyote aliyeingia nalo atatolewa kwenye programu. Utapata neno la siri la muda jipya la kumpa. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'new temporary password' written 'neno jipya la siri la muda' (jipya agrees with neno). Glossary 'neno la siri jipya' agrees with the closer noun; reviewer to settle agreement. |
| `farmerLogin.resetConfirmTitle` | Reset this farmer's app password? | Rudisha neno la siri la programu la mkulima huyu? | draft |  |
| `farmerLogin.resetting` | Resetting… | Inarudisha… | draft |  |
| `farmerLogin.retry` | Try again | Jaribu tena | draft |  |
| `farmerLogin.shownOnce` | Shown once. Write it down for the farmer now; it cannot be shown again. | Huonyeshwa mara moja. Liandike sasa kwa ajili ya mkulima; haliwezi kuonyeshwa tena. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Object concord 'li-' refers to 'neno la siri'; check reads naturally to a farmer/officer. |
| `farmerLogin.title` | App login for the farmer | Akaunti ya programu ya mkulima | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'App login' rendered as 'Akaunti ya programu' (app account). 'login' as a noun has no glossary term; also affects issue/history/audit strings. 'programu' for 'app' is common but unverified. |
| `farmerOpportunities.buyerWithOps` | Your field officer holds the buyer details. | Afisa wako wa uwandani ana taarifa za mnunuzi. | draft |  |
| `farmerOpportunities.noneDetail` | None of your harvest has been put forward to a buyer yet. | Bado hakuna mavuno yako yaliyopendekezwa kwa mnunuzi. | draft |  |
| `farmerOpportunities.noneTitle` | No opportunities yet | Bado hakuna fursa | draft |  |
| `farmerOpportunities.notASale` | An opportunity is not a sale, a delivery or a payment. It records that your harvest has been put forward to a buyer. Nothing has moved and nothing is owed. | Fursa si mauzo, si uwasilishaji wa mazao wala si malipo. Inaonyesha kwamba mavuno yako yamependekezwa kwa mnunuzi. Hakuna kilichohamishwa na hakuna deni lolote. | draft | An opportunity is NOT a sale, a delivery or a payment. "Accepted" means both sides agreed to keep talking. Flag: Drafter: Glossary bans 'mauzo' for the opportunity itself, but the negation 'not a sale' needs a word for sale; 'mauzo' used only inside the negation. 'delivery' rendered 'uwasilishaji wa mazao' (collides with 'wasilisha'=submit). 'Nothing is owed' = 'hakuna anayedaiwa chochote' unverified. Same in farmHome.notASale. |
| `farmerOpportunities.opportunityTotal` | Opportunity total | Jumla katika fursa hii | draft | An opportunity is NOT a sale, a delivery or a payment. "Accepted" means both sides agreed to keep talking. Flag: Cross-check (meaning): "Jumla ya fursa" can be read as the total number of opportunities, not the total quantity within this one opportunity. |

| `farmHome.notASale` | An opportunity is not a sale, a delivery or a payment. | Fursa si mauzo, si uwasilishaji wa mazao wala si malipo. | draft | An opportunity is NOT a sale, a delivery or a payment. "Accepted" means both sides agreed to keep talking. Flag: Drafter: Same as farmerOpportunities.notASale: 'mauzo' appears only in the negation. |

| `login.email` | Phone number or email | Namba ya simu au barua pepe | draft | Flag: Drafter: Key name says email but string is 'phone number or email'; 'barua pepe' is standard for email. |
| `login.emailInvalid` | Enter a Tanzanian mobile number, for example 0712 345 678, or an email address. | Weka namba ya simu ya mkononi ya Tanzania, kwa mfano 0712 345 678, au anwani ya barua pepe. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Example number 0712 345 678 kept as is. |
| `login.emailRequired` | Enter your phone number or email address. | Weka namba yako ya simu au anwani ya barua pepe. | draft |  |

| `myFarm.noPlots` | No plots recorded on this farm yet | Bado hakuna kipande cha shamba kilichorekodiwa katika shamba hili | draft |  |
| `myFarm.plots` | Plots | Vipande vya shamba | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Kipande cha shamba' for plot is glossary UNVERIFIED; used throughout. |

| `nav.people` | People | Watu | draft |  |
| `nav.redeem` | Redeem | Kabidhi | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Kabidhi' (hand over) per glossary for the officer redeem action; unverified, sense is handing cash over at the office. Cross-check (meaning): 'Kabidhi' back-translates to 'Hand over', dropping the voucher/redeem sense; as a bare nav label it does not say what is being handed over or that it is a voucher claim at the office. |
| `nav.register` | Register | Sajili | draft |  |
| `nav.requests` | Requests | Maombi | draft |  |
| `nav.signingOut` | Signing out… | Inatoka… | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Inatoka…' follows 'Toka'; could read as 'is leaving'. Alternative 'Inakutoa…' is not natural. |
| `nav.signOut` | Sign out | Toka | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Toka' chosen, unverified (alt 'Ondoka'). |
| `nav.surveys` | Surveys | Madodoso | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Madodoso' (plural of dodoso, questionnaire) used as the nav label; alternative 'Tafiti'. |
| `nav.tower` | Control Tower | Control Tower | draft | Flag: Drafter: Kept 'Control Tower' in English as a product/screen name; no glossary term. Reviewer may prefer a Swahili name. |

| `noAccess.nothingDetail` | This is a real screen with a next step — never a blank page, and never an error. | Hii ni skrini halisi yenye hatua inayofuata — kamwe si ukurasa mtupu, wala hitilafu. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Meta/developer-style English sentence; translated faithfully, native reviewer may simplify. |

| `noAccess.signOut` | Sign out | Toka | draft |  |

| `officerEdit.cancel` | Cancel | Ghairi | draft |  |
| `officerEdit.fields.confidence` | Confidence | Kiwango cha uhakika | draft | Confidence level recorded with a figure. Low / medium / high. |
| `officerEdit.fields.crop_id` | Crop | Zao | draft |  |
| `officerEdit.fields.cycle_area_ha` | Planted area (ha) | Eneo lililopandwa (ha) | draft | Flag: Same open question as register.cycleArea. Cross-check (glossary): The same English 'Planted area (ha)' (register.cycleArea, person.plantedArea) is 'Jumla ya eneo lililopandwa katika mazao yote' elsewhere but the short 'Eneo lililopandwa (ha)' here, so the across-cycles qualifier is dropped in the edit form and the same field has two labels. |
| `officerEdit.fields.family_name` | Family name | Jina la ukoo | draft |  |

| `officerEdit.fields.plot_label` | Plot name | Jina la kipande cha shamba | draft |  |
| `officerEdit.fields.quantity_kg` | Quantity (kg) | Kiasi (kg) | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Kiasi (kg)' per glossary for amounts. |
| `officerEdit.fields.reported_for` | Reported for | Taarifa kwa tarehe | draft | Flag: Cross-check said the first draft meant "date of the report". Replacement is not confident. Field means the date or period the figure applies to. Drafter: Field is a date; rendered 'Tarehe ya taarifa' (date of the report). Literal 'reported for' has no clean equivalent. Cross-check (meaning): 'Reported for' names the date or period the figure applies to. 'Tarehe ya taarifa' (date of the report) reads as the date the report was made, which is a different fact. |
| `officerEdit.fields.season_label` | Season | Msimu | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Msimu' (season). Free-text field; season taxonomy open under S22. Cross-check (meaning): 'Season' is 'Msimu' while 'Crop cycle' is 'Msimu wa zao' (and 'Misimu ya mazao'). In the same crop-cycle edit form the two different fields end up with near-identical names, which is confusing. The glossary locks the cycle term, so this needs a native decision. |

| `person.notFoundTitle` | Person not found | Mtu hajapatikana | draft |  |
| `person.plantedArea` | Planted area | Eneo lililopandwa | draft | This is planted area ACROSS CYCLES, never "land area": intercropping means it can exceed the village’s hectares. Flag: Same open question as register.cycleArea: on this screen the figure may be summed across cycles. Drafter: Glossary across-cycles phrase (UNVERIFIED); shortened form used in the edit field for the same concept. |

Chose 'bado haijahakikiwa' over 'bado inahitaji kuhakikiwa' for brevity; reviewer decide. |

| `register.crop` | Crop | Zao | draft |  |
| `register.cycleArea` | Planted area (ha) | Eneo lililopandwa (ha) | draft | This is planted area ACROSS CYCLES, never "land area": intercropping means it can exceed the village’s hectares. Flag: Wording changed after the cross-check to the short, English-faithful label. Open question: this field is planted area for one crop cycle, and business-rules says it is never "land area". Reviewer to confirm the label and whether "across cycles" belongs here. Drafter: Note requires 'planted area across cycles'; used the glossary full phrase (UNVERIFIED). But this is a single-cycle form field, so 'katika mazao yote' (across all crops) may read oddly; reviewer decide. officerEdit.fields.cycle_area_ha (no note) uses the short 'Eneo lililopandwa (ha)'. Cross-check (rule): The locked phrase says 'total area planted across all the crops' but this field records ONE crop cycle's area; an officer may enter a sum over all crops, and 'across crops' is not the same as the note's 'across cycles'. Also 49 characters for a 17-character English label. Needs native decision, not a silent change. |

Andika viwianishi mwenyewe, au | draft | Flag: Drafter: Sentence ends with 'au' because a 'Jaribu tena' button follows; 'viwianishi' (coordinates) is my word choice, not in glossary. Same for gpsUnsupported and gpsError. |
| `register.gpsDetecting` | Finding this farm's location… | Inatafuta mahali lilipo shamba hili… | draft |  |
| `register.gpsError` | Couldn't get a location just now. Enter the coordinates yourself, or | Imeshindwa kupata mahali kwa sasa. Andika viwianishi mwenyewe, au | draft |  |
| `register.gpsNote` | The farm's position is required. It comes from this phone's GPS; if GPS is not available, type it in. | Mahali pa shamba ni lazima. Hupatikana kupitia GPS ya simu hii; ikiwa GPS haipatikani, paandike mwenyewe. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Mahali pa shamba' (location of farm) used for 'position'; class-16 agreement 'paandike' is natural but check. |
| `register.gpsRetry` | Try again | Jaribu tena | draft |  |
| `register.gpsUnsupported` | This browser can't detect location. Enter the coordinates yourself, or | Kivinjari hiki hakiwezi kutambua mahali. Andika viwianishi mwenyewe, au | draft |  |

| `register.latitudeRange` | Latitude runs from -90 to 90. | Latitudo ni kati ya -90 na 90. | draft |  |
| `register.longitude` | Longitude | Longitudo | draft |  |
| `register.longitudeRange` | Longitude runs from -180 to 180. | Longitudo ni kati ya -180 na 180. | draft |  |
| `register.measuredBy` | {{crop}} is measured this way | {{crop}} hupimwa kwa njia hii | draft | Keep {{crop}} Flag: Drafter: Hint under area/trees/units meaning 'this crop is counted by this measure'. Meaning is my reading of the screen; wording 'hupimwa kwa njia hii' may be unclear. |

| `register.phoneHint` | Include the country code, for example +255700000101. | Weka msimbo wa nchi, kwa mfano +255700000101. | draft |  |
| `register.plantedOn` | Planted on | Tarehe ya kupanda | draft | Flag: Drafter: Used 'Tarehe ya kupanda' rather than 'Ilipopandwa'; glossary notes sources disagree on kupanda vs kuotesha. |
| `register.plotArea` | Plot area (ha) | Eneo la kipande cha shamba (ha) | draft |  |
| `register.plotLabel` | Plot name | Jina la kipande cha shamba | draft |  |

Hili si chaguo. | draft | Provenance wording: where a record came from, and who verified it. Flag: Drafter: 'Field-verified' rendered 'imehakikiwa shambani' (UNVERIFIED glossary); 'imeingizwa nawe' for 'captured by you'; 'Hili si chaguo' for 'This is not a choice'. |
| `register.registerAnother` | Register another | Sajili mwingine | draft |  |

| `register.sections.farm` | Farm | Shamba | draft |  |
| `register.sections.harvest` | Expected harvest | Mavuno yanayotarajiwa | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Mavuno yanayotarajiwa' UNVERIFIED (glossary). person.expected uses 'Inatarajiwa' for the short column label; person.actual 'Halisi' unchecked. |
| `register.sections.household` | Household | Kaya | draft |  |
| `register.sections.person` | Person | Mtu | draft |  |
| `register.sections.plot` | Plot | Kipande | draft | Flag: Drafter: Plot = 'kipande cha shamba' (UNVERIFIED, glossary). Used in full everywhere; long for a wizard rail label, may want 'Kipande'. |
| `register.submit` | Register | Sajili | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Sajili' as imperative for registering someone else (glossary). registerAnother 'Sajili mwingine' assumes 'mkulima' understood. |
| `register.submitting` | Registering… | Inasajili… | draft |  |
| `register.successDetail` | The records were created together. | Rekodi zimeundwa pamoja. | draft |  |

| `requests.action.submit` | Send this request | Tuma ombi hili | draft |  |
| `requests.action.withdraw` | Withdraw | Ondoa ombi | draft | Flag: Cross-check: "Ondoa ombi" may read as deleting the request. Withdraw means the farmer takes it back and the record remains. Drafter: 'Withdraw' = 'Ondoa ombi' (glossary 'remove'); may read as delete rather than withdraw. Cross-check (meaning): "Ondoa ombi" back-translates as "Remove request", which reads like deleting; English Withdraw means the farmer takes the request back but the record remains. |

| `tour.farmer.equipmentEstimateBody` | Rated power times how many gives the estimated peak power. Times hours per day gives kWh a day, and times days per week gives kWh a week. It comes from your figures, so it stays an estimate. | Nguvu iliyoandikwa mara idadi inatoa kilele kilichokadiriwa. Mara saa kwa siku inatoa kWh kwa siku, na mara siku kwa wiki inatoa kWh kwa wiki. Yanatokana na namba zako, kwa hiyo yanabaki kuwa makadirio. | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. Flag: Drafter: Uses on-screen label 'kilele kilichokadiriwa' for Estimated peak (glossary [UNVERIFIED]); 'mara' for multiplication in prose. |

| `tour.farmer.equipmentListBody` | Powered equipment the programme offers, with its rated power and an indicative price. A price is a guide, not a quotation, and nothing is ordered from this list. | Vifaa vya umeme vinavyopatikana kupitia mradi, pamoja na nguvu iliyoandikwa na bei ya makadirio. Bei ni mwongozo tu, si nukuu ya bei, na hakuna kinachoagizwa kutoka kwenye orodha hii. | draft |  |

"Endelea" inakufungulia cha kwanza. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Tap' = Gusa (touch-screen verb, no Tanzanian source); reviewer to confirm. |

Until you send it, what you type is kept on this device as a draft, so a reload does not lose it. | Kitufe cha "Wasilisha ombi" kinalituma kwa timu ya uendeshaji lipitiwe, na ziara haikibonyezi kamwe.

| `tour.farmer.equipmentTryBody` | Change how many, hours per day or days per week and watch the estimate move. It is an estimate, not a measurement. A figure that is impossible, like 30 hours a day, hides it until you correct it. | Badilisha idadi, saa kwa siku au siku kwa wiki uone makadirio yakibadilika. Ni makadirio, si kipimo. Namba isiyowezekana, kama saa 30 kwa siku, huficha makadirio hadi uirekebishe. | draft |  |

The Requests tab keeps the whole list. | Kifaa cha mwisho ulichoomba na kilipofikia — kinasubiri, kinapitiwa, kimeidhinishwa au kimekataliwa. Kichupo cha Maombi kina orodha nzima. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Statuses used as verbs (kinasubiri, kinapitiwa) matching requestStatus labels; 'Inapitiwa' is unverified in glossary. |
| `tour.farmer.homeLatestRequestTitle` | Your latest request | Ombi lako la karibuni | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.homeOpportunitiesBody` | This counts the opportunities your expected harvest is part of. An opportunity is not a sale, a delivery or a payment — the Opportunities tab has the detail. | Hii inahesabu fursa zenye mavuno yako yanayotarajiwa. Fursa si mauzo, si uwasilishaji wa mazao wala si malipo — kichupo cha Fursa kina maelezo zaidi. | draft | Flag: Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |
| `tour.farmer.homeOpportunitiesTitle` | Is your harvest in an opportunity? | Je, mavuno yako yamo katika fursa? | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.myFarmBadgeBody` | This badge says who reported the record and whether an officer has checked it. Unverified is not the same as wrong. You can read your records here but not change them — ask your field officer. | Lebo hii inaonyesha nani aliripoti rekodi na kama afisa ameihakiki. Haijahakikiwa haimaanishi si sahihi. Unaweza kusoma rekodi zako hapa lakini huwezi kuzibadilisha — mwombe afisa wako wa uwandani. | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.myFarmBadgeTitle` | Where every figure came from | Kila kiasi kilitoka wapi | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.myFarmCropBody` | The harvest window, and the expected harvest in kilograms. Expected means planned, not weighed — the small badge under it says who reported it and whether it has been checked. | Kipindi cha kuvuna, na mavuno yanayotarajiwa kwa kilo (kg). Yanayotarajiwa yanamaanisha yaliyopangwa, si yaliyopimwa — lebo ndogo iliyo chini yake inaonyesha nani aliyeyaripoti na kama yamehakikiwa. | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.myFarmCropTitle` | A crop and its harvest | Zao na mavuno yake | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.myFarmPlotBody` | Each plot shows its area in hectares, with the crops grown there listed underneath. | Kila kipande cha shamba kinaonyesha eneo lake kwa hekta, na mazao yanayolimwa hapo yameorodheshwa chini yake. | draft |  |

| `tour.farmer.nextFarmBody` | To collect the cash, the household shows the voucher at the Ruaha office. In the demo, sign in next as a field officer who neither registered nor verified this household: they scan the voucher and hand the cash over. | Ili kuchukua fedha taslimu, kaya inaonyesha vocha katika ofisi ya Ruaha. Katika demo, hatua inayofuata ni kuingia kama afisa wa uwandani ambaye hakusajili wala kuhakiki kaya hii: anaskani vocha na kukabidhi fedha taslimu. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'demo' kept as a loanword; 'ingia' after 'hatua inayofuata ni kuingia' reads as instruction, not action. |
| `tour.farmer.nextFarmTitle` | The farmer side is done | Upande wa mkulima umekamilika | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.opportunitiesBody` | An opportunity is a buyer looking for a crop, matched to what your village expects to harvest. It is not a sale, a delivery or a payment — nothing is owed either way. | Fursa ni mnunuzi anayetafuta zao, aliyelinganishwa na mavuno ambayo kijiji chako kinatarajia. Si uuzaji, si uwasilishaji wala malipo — hakuna anayedaiwa upande wowote. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Must say 'not a sale, a delivery or a payment'. Used 'uuzaji' for sale (avoiding mauzo/mkataba per glossary), 'uwasilishaji' for delivery, 'malipo' for payment. Native reviewer to confirm wording; 'malipo' is fine here (not an incentive string) but check any test scanning the whole file. |
| `tour.farmer.opportunitiesShareBody` | How much of your expected harvest is inside this opportunity, in kilograms. It has been put forward to a buyer — it has not been sold or delivered. | Kiasi cha mavuno yako yanayotarajiwa kilichomo katika fursa hii, kwa kilo (kg). Kimependekezwa kwa mnunuzi — hakijauzwa wala kufikishwa. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'delivered' = 'kufikishwa' rather than 'kuwasilishwa', which also means 'submitted'; existing bundle uses 'uwasilishaji wa mazao' for delivery. Reviewer to pick one. Cross-check (low): 'kufikishwa' for 'delivered' differs from the bundle's 'uwasilishaji wa mazao' used in the not-a-sale sentences; same idea, different word. |
| `tour.farmer.opportunitiesShareTitle` | Your share | Sehemu yako | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.opportunitiesTitle` | Opportunities near you | Fursa karibu nawe | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.opportunitiesTotalBody` | The total across everyone whose harvest is in it, so it is never less than your share. The buyer's name is not shown here — your field officer holds those details. | Jumla ya kila mtu ambaye mavuno yake yamo ndani yake, kwa hiyo haiwezi kuwa chini ya sehemu yako. Jina la mnunuzi halionyeshwi hapa — afisa wako wa uwandani ana taarifa hizo. | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.opportunitiesTotalTitle` | The whole opportunity | Fursa nzima | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.recordsBody` | Each record carries a badge saying who recorded it and whether an officer has verified it. Unverified does not mean wrong; it means nobody has checked it yet. | Kila rekodi ina lebo inayoonyesha nani aliiandika na kama afisa ameihakiki. Haijahakikiwa haimaanishi si sahihi; inamaanisha bado hakuna aliyeikagua. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Badge' rendered as 'lebo' (my choice, not in glossary); glossary's ProvenanceBadge wording is 'chanzo cha taarifa'. 'Haijahakikiwa' [UNVERIFIED]. |

| `tour.farmer.requestsAssumptionsBody` | The figures this request was made with. A sent request cannot be edited: you can withdraw it until ops start reviewing, and after that your field officer can help with a correction. | Namba ambazo ombi hili liliwasilishwa nazo. Ombi lililotumwa haliwezi kubadilishwa: unaweza kuliondoa hadi timu ya uendeshaji ianze kulipitia, na baada ya hapo afisa wako wa uwandani anaweza kusaidia kurekebisha. | draft | Flag: Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |

| `tour.farmer.requestsDecisionBody` | When ops approve a request or turn it down, their note and the date appear here, so you can see the reason. | Timu ya uendeshaji inapoidhinisha ombi au kulikataa, maelezo yake na tarehe vinaonekana hapa, ili uone sababu. | draft |  |

It was worked out from the figures above, and it is an estimate, not a measurement. | Makadirio yaliyohifadhiwa pamoja na ombi lako: kilele kilichokadiriwa, kWh kwa siku na kWh kwa wiki. Yalikokotolewa kutokana na namba zilizo hapo juu, na ni makadirio, si kipimo. | draft | Always labelled an ESTIMATE. Not a measurement, not a commitment. |

The number on this tab is how many surveys are waiting for you. | Jibu dodoso na kaya yako itapokea motisha ya kiasi maalum cha fedha taslimu, mara moja kwa kila dodoso. Utapata namba ya vocha; ionyeshe kwenye ofisi ya Ruaha ili uchukue fedha hizo. Namba iliyo kwenye kichupo hiki ni idadi ya madodoso yanayokusubiri. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Incentive string: motisha, vocha, kiasi maalum cha fedha taslimu used; none of the banned words present. 'Namba ya vocha' and 'kichupo' (tab) are composed [UNVERIFIED]. |
| `tour.farmer.surveysCardBody` | New means you can answer it now. Answered keeps your voucher. Not available gives the reason — for example, that the survey has closed. | Jipya linamaanisha unaweza kulijibu sasa. Limejibiwa hutunza vocha yako. Halipatikani hutoa sababu — kwa mfano, dodoso limefungwa. | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.surveysCardTitle` | One card for each survey | Kadi moja kwa kila dodoso | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.surveysIncentiveBody` | A fixed cash amount for your household, once per survey. You collect it at the Ruaha office by showing the voucher you get when you answer. | Kiasi maalum cha fedha taslimu kwa kaya yako, mara moja kwa kila dodoso. Unakichukua katika ofisi ya Ruaha kwa kuonyesha vocha unayopata unapojibu. | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.surveysIncentiveTitle` | The incentive | Motisha | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.surveysOpenBody` | Answer survey opens the questions. Next opens the first new survey for you — nothing is sent until you submit your answers. | "Jibu dodoso" inafungua maswali. "Endelea" inakufungulia dodoso la kwanza jipya — hakuna kinachotumwa hadi uwasilishe majibu yako. | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.surveysOpenTitle` | Open a survey | Fungua dodoso | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.surveysQuestionsBody` | Each question says whether it is required. Answers can be a choice, yes or no, a number or a few words. Your household answers each survey once, so check before you submit. | Kila swali linaonyesha kama ni lazima. Majibu yanaweza kuwa chaguo, ndiyo au hapana, namba au maneno machache. Kaya yako hujibu kila dodoso mara moja, kwa hiyo kagua kabla ya kuwasilisha. | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.surveysQuestionsTitle` | Answering a survey | Kujibu dodoso | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.surveysSubmitBody` | Submit answers is final for this survey, and your voucher is issued as soon as it is sent. The tour never presses it. What you type is kept on this device until you send it. | "Wasilisha majibu" ni ya mwisho kwa dodoso hili, na vocha yako inatolewa mara tu majibu yanapotumwa. Ziara haibonyezi kitufe hicho kamwe. Unachoandika kinahifadhiwa kwenye kifaa hiki hadi utakapotuma. | draft |  |

| `tour.farmer.surveysTitle` | Surveys, and the incentive for answering | Madodoso, na motisha ya kujibu | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.voucherAmountBody` | The fixed cash amount your household collects at the Ruaha office for this survey. It is set by the survey, not by how you answered. | Kiasi maalum cha fedha taslimu ambacho kaya yako inachukua katika ofisi ya Ruaha kwa dodoso hili. Kinawekwa na dodoso, si na jinsi ulivyojibu. | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.voucherAmountTitle` | The amount | Kiasi | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.voucherCodeBody` | Staff at the Ruaha office scan the QR code or type this code. Only your household can see it. | Wafanyakazi wa ofisi ya Ruaha wanaskani msimbo wa QR au wanaandika namba hii. Kaya yako pekee ndiyo inayoweza kuiona. | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.voucherCodeTitle` | The code | Msimbo | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.voucherSlipBody` | A claim slip for a fixed cash amount — not money held in the app. While it waits to be collected it carries a QR code for staff at the Ruaha office to scan, and it works once. | Hati ya kudai kiasi maalum cha fedha taslimu — si fedha zilizohifadhiwa kwenye programu. Inaposubiri kuchukuliwa ina msimbo wa QR ambao wafanyakazi wa ofisi ya Ruaha wanaskani, na inatumika mara moja. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'claim slip' = 'hati ya kudai' is a composed term; no Tanzanian source. 'Not money held in the app' avoids pochi/salio. Cross-check (low): 'hati ya kudai' (kudai also means to demand a debt owed) is an unverified composed term; the meaning and rule (fixed cash, not money held in the app) are preserved. |
| `tour.farmer.voucherSlipTitle` | Your voucher | Vocha yako | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.voucherTrailBody` | Each step on this voucher, with names: when you answered, when it was issued and, once collected, who handed the incentive over. The record cannot be changed. | Kila hatua kwenye vocha hii, pamoja na majina: ulipojibu, ilipotolewa, na — ikishachukuliwa — nani aliyekabidhi motisha. Rekodi hii haiwezi kubadilishwa. | draft | Flag: Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |
| `tour.farmer.voucherTrailTitle` | Who did what | Nani alifanya nini | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.voucherValidityBody` | Until it is collected, this line gives the date the voucher stays valid. Once collected, it gives the date and the name of the person who handed the cash over. | Hadi itakapochukuliwa, mstari huu unaonyesha tarehe ambayo vocha inaendelea kutumika. Ikishachukuliwa, unaonyesha tarehe na jina la mtu aliyekabidhi fedha. | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.voucherValidityTitle` | Valid until, then handed over | Inatumika hadi, kisha imekabidhiwa | draft | Flag: Cross-check (low): 'Inatumika hadi, kisha imekabidhiwa' is an unfinished clause ('until' with no date) and mixes a voucher subject with a cash hand-over; mirrors the English but sounds clumsy. |
| `tour.farmer.voucherViewBody` | Every survey you have answered keeps a View voucher button. Next opens the first one. | Kila dodoso ulilolijibu lina kitufe cha "Angalia vocha". "Endelea" inafungua cha kwanza. | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.voucherViewTitle` | Open a voucher | Fungua vocha | draft |  |
| `tour.farmer.welcomeBody` | This is your own record. Everything here was written by a field officer who visited your farm, and every figure shows where it came from. The tour button in the header (the person icon on a phone) shows you any part of the app whenever you want. | Hii ni rekodi yako mwenyewe. Kila kitu hapa kiliandikwa na afisa wa uwandani aliyetembelea shamba lako, na kila kiasi kinaonyesha chanzo chake. Kitufe cha Ziara kilicho juu ya ukurasa (ikoni ya mtu kwenye simu) kinakuonyesha sehemu yoyote ya programu wakati wowote unapotaka. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Tour button' rendered as 'kitufe cha Ziara'; the header label's own Swahili (tour.restart 'Rudia ziara') differs slightly. Confirm what the button shows. Cross-check (low): Says 'Kitufe cha Ziara' but the header button reads 'Rudia ziara' (tour.restart), so the quoted name differs from the screen (the English is also loose here). |
| `tour.farmer.welcomeTabsBody` | The tabs along the bottom open My farm, Equipment, Requests, Opportunities and Surveys — Surveys shows a number when one is waiting. The Tour button in the header replays any part of this tour. | Vichupo vilivyo chini vinafungua Shamba langu, Vifaa, Maombi, Fursa na Madodoso — Madodoso huonyesha namba wakati dodoso linakusubiri. Kitufe cha Ziara kilicho juu kinarudia sehemu yoyote ya ziara hii. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'tabs' = vichupo (same as existing tour strings); 'a number when one is waiting' compressed to 'huonyesha namba dodoso linapokusubiri'.

| `tour.next` | Next | Endelea | draft | Flag: Changed to the imperative "Endelea" (also "Continue"). Reviewer may prefer another word for "Next". Drafter: Glossary gives 'Inayofuata' [UNVERIFIED]; it is not a bare imperative. 'Endelea' (continue) is the attested alternative. Cross-check (glossary): 'Inayofuata' is not a bare imperative (back-translation 'The next one'), against the editorial decision that buttons are bare imperatives; drafter also flagged it. |

Everything you record starts unverified. | Kazi yako kuu. Hii inafungua ukurasa mmoja unaorekodi mkulima mzima: mtu, kaya, shamba, kipande cha shamba, msimu wa zao na mavuno yanayotarajiwa.

A household you registered needs a second staff member to verify it, so it stays counted until they do. | Hii inahesabu rekodi katika vijiji vyako ambazo bado zinahitaji kuhakikiwa, pamoja na kila ulichosajili sasa hivi.

Sign in as the farmer with the phone and temporary password from the login card and answer it. Then redeem the voucher as an officer who neither registered nor verified that household. | Mwombe mfanyakazi mwingine ahakiki kaya yako, kisha msimamizi achapishe dodoso. Ingia kama mkulima kwa simu na neno la siri la muda kutoka kwenye kadi ya kuingia kisha ulijibu. Halafu kabidhi vocha ukiwa afisa ambaye hakusajili wala kuhakiki kaya hiyo. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'achapishe' (publish a survey): bundle shows survey status 'Linaendelea' but no verb for publish; 'Chapisha' is the plain choice, verify it matches the admin Publish button. |

Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |

Endelea inakufungulia mtu wa kwanza. | draft | Flag: Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |
| `tour.officer.redeemBody` | Scan the farmer's voucher, check their ID and hand over the cash. You cannot redeem a voucher for a household you registered or verified, and some vouchers are held for ops to redeem in person. Every scan is recorded with your name. | Skani vocha ya mkulima, angalia kitambulisho chake kisha kabidhi fedha taslimu. Huwezi kukabidhi vocha ya kaya uliyoisajili au kuihakiki, na baadhi ya vocha zimeshikiliwa ili uendeshaji uzikabidhi ana kwa ana. Kila skani inarekodiwa pamoja na jina lako. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Officer-side redeem rendered as 'kabidhi' (hand over) per glossary; 'ops' rendered 'uendeshaji' [UNVERIFIED role label]. 'Skani' per glossary. |
| `tour.officer.redeemCodeBody` | If the camera isn't available or the code won't scan, type the code shown under the QR code. It works exactly the same way. | Kamera isipopatikana au msimbo usiposomeka, andika namba iliyo chini ya msimbo wa QR. Inafanya kazi kwa njia ile ile kabisa. | draft |  |
| `tour.officer.redeemCodeTitle` | Or type the code | Au andika namba | draft |  |
| `tour.officer.redeemLookupBody` | Look up shows the household and the fixed cash amount. You then record which ID you saw and confirm the name matches, never the number. If you may not redeem it, it says why. Every look-up is logged with your name. | Tafuta inaonyesha kaya na kiasi maalum cha fedha taslimu. Kisha unarekodi aina ya kitambulisho ulichoona na kuthibitisha kuwa jina linalingana, kamwe si namba. Kama huruhusiwi kukabidhi, inaeleza sababu.

The QR code is a single-use claim slip. | Mkulima anaonyesha msimbo wa QR wa vocha yake kwenye simu yake. Gusa hapa, elekeza kamera kwenye msimbo na utasomwa kwa ajili yako.

It appears on each record's badge afterwards. | Chagua chini, wastani au juu: ni maoni yako mwenyewe kuhusu jinsi taarifa zilivyo na uhakika. Baadaye huonekana kwenye lebo ya kila rekodi. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'alama' used for the record badge (no bundle precedent for 'badge'); 'maoni yako mwenyewe' for 'your own judgement' is plain but unchecked. Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |
| `tour.officer.registerConfidenceTitle` | How sure are you? | Una uhakika kiasi gani? | draft |  |
| `tour.officer.registerDraftBody` | Fill in a first and family name. Nothing is registered: what you type is kept as a draft on this phone only. Reload the page and it is still there. | Jaza jina la kwanza na jina la ukoo. Hakuna kinachosajiliwa: unachoandika kinahifadhiwa kama rasimu kwenye simu hii pekee. Pakia ukurasa upya na bado kipo. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Pakia ukurasa upya' for 'reload the page'; 'pakia' is unverified in glossary. |
| `tour.officer.registerDraftTitle` | Type a made-up name | Andika jina la kubuni | draft |  |
| `tour.officer.registerFarmBody` | This phone's GPS fills in the latitude and longitude once you allow location. If it can't, try again or type the coordinates yourself. | GPS ya simu hii hujaza latitudo na longitudo baada ya kuruhusu simu ipate mahali. Ikishindwa, jaribu tena au andika viwianishi mwenyewe. | draft | Flag: Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |

| `tour.officer.verifyBody` | Everything awaiting verification, in one list. Verifying says you have seen the record yourself. There is no way to un-verify, so leave anything you are unsure of. | Kila kinachosubiri kuhakikiwa, kwenye orodha moja. Kuhakiki kunamaanisha umeiona rekodi mwenyewe. Hakuna njia ya kubatilisha, kwa hiyo acha chochote ambacho huna uhakika nacho. | draft |  |
| `tour.officer.verifyCountBody` | Records in your villages that nobody has verified yet: people, households, farms, plots, crop cycles and harvest figures. The number falls as they are verified. | Rekodi katika vijiji vyako ambazo hakuna aliyezihakiki bado: watu, kaya, mashamba, vipande vya shamba, misimu ya mazao na kiasi cha mavuno. Namba hupungua kadri zinavyohakikiwa. | draft |  |
| `tour.officer.verifyCountTitle` | How many are waiting | Ngapi zinasubiri | draft |  |
| `tour.officer.verifyRowCheckBody` | Check the record first: most rows open it when tapped. Verify attaches your name, asks you to confirm and cannot be undone. A household you registered shows a note instead: another staff member must verify it. | Kagua rekodi kwanza: mistari mingi hufungua rekodi ikiguswa. Hakiki inaambatisha jina lako, inakuomba uthibitishe na haiwezi kutenguliwa. Kaya uliyoisajili huonyesha ujumbe badala yake: mfanyakazi mwingine lazima aihakiki. | draft | Flag: Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |

The tour button in the header (the person icon on a phone) shows you any part of it again whenever you want. | Hii ni sehemu ya afisa wa uwandani. Unasajili wakulima, unahakiki ulichorekodi, na unakabidhi motisha za madodoso. Kitufe cha ziara juu ya skrini (alama ya mtu kwenye simu) kinakuonyesha sehemu yoyote tena wakati wowote unapotaka. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'kitufe cha ziara' / 'alama ya mtu' (person icon): 'alama' used for icon and for badge; 'ziara' for tour is unverified in glossary. |
| `tour.officer.welcomeTabsBody` | Register adds a farmer. People finds and opens their records. Verify clears what nobody has checked yet. Redeem hands over a survey incentive. The Tour button in the header replays any part. | Sajili huongeza mkulima. Watu hukuwezesha kutafuta na kufungua rekodi zao. Hakiki huondoa yale ambayo hakuna aliyeyakagua bado.

Jina lako litaambatishwa, na kitendo hiki hakiwezi kutenguliwa. | draft | Keep {{record}} Flag: Drafter: 'Jina lako litaambatishwa' and 'hakiwezi kutenguliwa' composed; check natural phrasing for 'cannot be undone'. Cross-check (glossary): English says 'confirming' (Thibitisha in the glossary) but Swahili uses 'Unahakiki' (Hakiki = verify). This keeps the dialog consistent with its Verify title and button, but breaks the locked Hakiki/Thibitisha split, so the product owner should decide deliberately. |
| `verifyDialog.title` | Verify this record? | Hakiki rekodi hii? | draft |  |
| `verifyQueue.householdNeedsSecondStaff` | You registered this household, so another staff member must verify it. | Ulisajili kaya hii, kwa hiyo mfanyakazi mwingine lazima aihakiki. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Mfanyakazi' used for 'staff member'; alternative 'mwenzako wa kazi'. Avoided 'wewe' via verb prefix. |
| `verifyQueue.intro` | Records captured in your villages that nobody has checked yet. Verifying attaches your name to the record. | Rekodi zilizokusanywa katika vijiji vyako ambazo bado hakuna aliyezikagua. Kuhakiki kunaambatisha jina lako kwenye rekodi. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Kuhakiki kunaambatisha jina lako' composed; 'ambatisha' (attach) not in glossary. |

| `voucher.showAtOffice` | Show this code at the Ruaha office. A staff member scans it and hands over the incentive. It can be used once. | Onyesha msimbo huu katika ofisi ya Ruaha. Mfanyakazi ataskani na kukukabidhi motisha. Vocha hii inaweza kutumika mara moja. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'staff member' -> 'Mfanyakazi' (no glossary term); 'ataskani' verb form from loan 'skani' unattested.

| `buyers.channel.direct` | Direct | Moja kwa moja | draft |  |
| `buyers.channel.other` | Other | Nyingine | draft |  |
| `buyers.channelNote` | Channel is a label describing how the buyer was reached. 'AFM' records that origin only — there is no integration and no partnership implied. | Njia ni lebo inayoeleza jinsi mnunuzi alivyofikiwa. 'AFM' inarekodi asili hiyo tu — hakuna muunganisho wa kimfumo na hakuna ushirikiano unaodokezwa. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'muunganisho wa kimfumo' for 'integration' is composed; the not-implied-partnership caveat kept in full. |
| `buyers.colActive` | Active | Hai | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Hai' (alive/active) for Active flag; alternative 'Anatumika'. |
| `buyers.colChannel` | Channel | Njia | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Njia' (way/route) for Channel; alternative 'Chaneli'. Composed sense: how the buyer was reached. |
| `buyers.colContact` | Contact note | Maelezo ya mawasiliano | draft | Flag: Cross-check (low): English is 'Contact note' (free-text note); 'Maelezo ya mawasiliano' back-translates as 'Contact details', implying structured contact data rather than a note. |
| `buyers.colName` | Buyer | Mnunuzi | draft |  |
| `buyers.create` | Add buyer | Ongeza mnunuzi | draft |  |
| `buyers.createTitle` | Add a buyer | Ongeza mnunuzi | draft |  |

| `coverage.availableNow` | Available now | Ugavi unaopatikana sasa | draft |  |
| `coverage.committed` | Already committed | Tayari umeahidiwa | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Tayari umeahidiwa' follows glossary 'ugavi ulioahidiwa' [UNVERIFIED]. |
| `coverage.committedNote` | Committed supply is promised to a live opportunity and is not available again. | Ugavi uliowekewa ahadi kwa fursa inayoendelea hautapatikana tena. | draft | Flag: Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |
| `coverage.coverageOf` | Coverage of {{total}} | Yaliyokidhiwa kati ya {{total}} | draft | Keep {{total}} |
| `coverage.demand` | Demand | Mahitaji | draft |  |
| `coverage.label` | Coverage | Yaliyokidhiwa | draft | Flag: Drafter: Coverage rendered 'Yaliyokidhiwa' (glossary label suggestion); 'Ufikiaji/wigo' avoided. [UNVERIFIED] Cross-check (low): 'Yaliyokidhiwa' is a bare relative clause ('those met'); as a standalone label it reads as a fragment and the back-translator needed a gloss. Also drops the word 'demand', so it could be read as any met quantity. |

| `demand.colBuyer` | Buyer | Mnunuzi | draft |  |
| `demand.colCoverable` | Coverable | Kinachoweza kukidhi | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Coverable' (how much of the demand a village could meet) has no glossary term; 'Kinachoweza kukidhi' is composed from the attested 'kukidhi' (coverage decision 'yaliyokidhiwa'). Cross-check (low): 'Kinachoweza kukidhi' has no object and needed a parenthetical '(the demand)' in the back-translation; unclear as a bare column header. Already flagged by the drafter. |

| `demand.crop` | Crop | Zao | draft |  |
| `demand.deliveryPoint` | Delivery point | Mahali pa kuwasilisha | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Delivery point' = 'Mahali pa kuwasilisha' (composed, unverified); 'kupokea' (receiving) is a possible alternative. |

| `demand.noneTitle` | No demand recorded yet | Bado hakuna mahitaji yaliyorekodiwa | draft |  |
| `demand.noSupplyDetail` | No village has available supply of this crop in this window. That is an honest zero, not a missing row. | Hakuna kijiji chenye ugavi unaopatikana wa zao hili katika kipindi hiki. Hilo ni sifuri ya kweli, si safu iliyokosekana. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'not a missing row' rendered as 'si safu iliyokosekana' (safu = table row); staff-facing, unverified. |
| `demand.noSupplyTitle` | No matching supply | Hakuna ugavi unaolingana | draft |  |
| `demand.notANumber` | Enter a number. | Andika namba. | draft |  |
| `demand.notASale` | An opportunity is not a sale, a delivery or a payment. It records that a village could supply a buyer. | Fursa si mauzo, si uwasilishaji wa mazao wala si malipo. Inarekodi kwamba kijiji kinaweza kumsambazia mnunuzi. | draft | An opportunity is NOT a sale, a delivery or a payment. "Accepted" means both sides agreed to keep talking. |

| `demand.notFoundTitle` | Demand not found | Mahitaji hayakupatikana | draft |  |
| `demand.priceNotANumber` | Enter a number, using a point for decimals (for example 12.5). | Andika namba, ukitumia nukta kwa desimali (kwa mfano 12.5). | draft | Prices are INDICATIVE, never quotations. Must not read as a firm offer. |
| `demand.pricePerKg` | Indicative price per kg | Bei ya makadirio kwa kg | draft | Prices are INDICATIVE, never quotations. Must not read as a firm offer. |

Flag: Drafter: 'Mark lapsed' = 'Weka imeisha muda' composed from unverified 'Imeisha muda wake'; may be worded better by a native reader. Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |
| `opportunity.actionShare` | Share with buyer | Shirikisha mnunuzi | draft | An opportunity is NOT a sale, a delivery or a payment. "Accepted" means both sides agreed to keep talking. Flag: Drafter: 'Share with buyer' = 'Shirikisha mnunuzi' (from status 'Imeshirikishwa'); can read as 'involve the buyer'. Unverified. Cross-check (low): 'Shirikisha mnunuzi' can read as 'involve the buyer'; the blind back-translation hedged between 'involve' and 'share with'. Consistent with the existing status 'Imeshirikishwa', so left for the native reviewer. |
| `opportunity.attach` | Attach | Ambatisha | draft | An opportunity is NOT a sale, a delivery or a payment. "Accepted" means both sides agreed to keep talking. |
| `opportunity.attachClosedDetail` | This opportunity is closed, so its supply no longer counts as committed.

| `tour.ops.authoringDraftBody` | A draft is the only stage where the wording can change. Next opens the draft survey, so you can see how one is written. | Rasimu ndiyo hatua pekee ambapo maneno yanaweza kubadilishwa. Endelea hufungua dodoso ambalo bado ni rasimu, ili uone jinsi linavyoandikwa. | draft |  |
| `tour.ops.authoringDraftTitle` | Open the draft | Fungua rasimu | draft |  |
| `tour.ops.authoringEditorBody` | Title and description in English and Swahili, the fixed incentive per household, an optional cap on households and closing date, and the share of vouchers held for ops to hand over in person. Save draft keeps changes. | Kichwa na maelezo kwa Kiingereza na Kiswahili, motisha ya kiasi maalum kwa kila kaya, kikomo cha idadi ya kaya na tarehe ya kufungwa (vyote si lazima), na sehemu ya vocha zinazoshikiliwa ili uendeshaji uzikabidhi ana kwa ana. Hifadhi rasimu huhifadhi mabadiliko. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Title' of a survey rendered as 'kichwa'; 'cap on households' = 'kikomo cha idadi ya kaya'. |
| `tour.ops.authoringEditorTitle` | What the form holds | Fomu ina nini | draft |  |
| `tour.ops.authoringPublishBody` | Publish opens the survey to eligible households at once. The questions and incentive then lock, and households registered after it goes live cannot answer it. The tour never presses it. | Chapisha hufungua dodoso mara moja kwa kaya zinazostahiki. Maswali na motisha kisha haviwezi kubadilishwa tena, na kaya zilizosajiliwa baada ya kuchapishwa hazitaweza kulijibu. Ziara haibonyezi kitufe hicho kamwe. | draft | Flag: Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |
| `tour.ops.authoringPublishTitle` | Publishing is one-way | Kuchapisha hakuwezi kutenguliwa | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Publish' = Chapisha, 'publishing' = kuchapisha; no Tanzanian UI source for a survey publish button. Must match surveyAdmin.publish in o1. 'Cannot be undone' = kubatilishwa, matching the officer tour's 'kubatilisha'. Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |
| `tour.ops.authoringQuestionsBody` | Each question is one choice, several choices, yes or no, a number, or free text. Mark it required and use the arrows to reorder. A choice question needs an English label on every option. | Kila swali ni chaguo moja, chaguo kadhaa, ndiyo au hapana, namba, au maandishi huru. Liweke kuwa lazima na tumia mishale kubadilisha mpangilio. Swali la chaguo linahitaji lebo ya Kiingereza kwenye kila chaguo. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Mark it required' = 'Liweke kuwa lazima'; 'arrows' = 'mishale'.

| `tour.ops.demandActionsBody` | It moves from proposed to shared to accepted, and can be declined or lapse at any live point. Those two ask you to confirm, release the committed supply and cannot be undone — so the tour presses none of these. | Inasogea kutoka imependekezwa hadi imeshirikishwa hadi imekubaliwa, na inaweza kukataliwa na mnunuzi au kuisha muda wake katika hatua yoyote ambayo bado inaendelea. Hizo mbili zinakuomba uthibitishe, zinaachilia ugavi ulioahidiwa na haziwezi kutenguliwa — kwa hiyo ziara haibonyezi hata moja kati ya hizi. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Status names used inline (imependekezwa, imeshirikishwa, imekubaliwa; declined = 'kukataliwa na mnunuzi'; lapsed = 'kuisha muda wake').

Asking for more than is available is refused, quoting the real kilograms. | Chagua mavuno yanayotarajiwa na kilo yanazochangia. Kuambatisha kunaahidi ugavi huo na hakuwezi kutenganishwa, kwa hiyo fanya hivyo papo hapo kwenye fursa uliyoiunda mwenyewe. Kuomba zaidi ya kinachopatikana kunakataliwa, na ujumbe hutaja kilo zilizopo kweli. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Cannot be detached' = 'hakuwezi kutenganishwa'; 'is refused, quoting the real kilograms' = 'kunakataliwa, na ujumbe hutaja kilo zilizopo kweli'.

| `tour.ops.demandBody` | What buyers are asking for, and how much of it a village could cover. Prices are indicative throughout. Creating an opportunity records a match — it is not a sale. | Kile wanunuzi wanachotaka, na kiasi ambacho kijiji kinaweza kukidhi. Bei zote ni za makadirio, si nukuu ya bei. Kuunda fursa kunarekodi kwamba mnunuzi amelinganishwa na kijiji — si uuzaji. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Adds 'si nukuu ya bei' after 'Bei zote ni za makadirio' per glossary decision (indicative = bei ya makadirio, always with si nukuu ya bei). English only says 'indicative'. Also 'a match' rendered as a clause (mnunuzi amelinganishwa na kijiji) because no plain noun for 'match' exists in the glossary. |
| `tour.ops.demandCoverageBody` | Available now is expected harvest not yet promised; not covered is what the demand still lacks. Committed supply is promised to a live opportunity and sits below the line — it is never added to the bar. | Kinachopatikana sasa ni mavuno yanayotarajiwa ambayo bado hayajaahidiwa; kisichokidhiwa ni kile ambacho mahitaji bado yanakosa. Ugavi ulioahidiwa umeahidiwa kwa fursa inayoendelea na uko chini ya mstari — haujumlishwi kamwe kwenye upau. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Legend labels 'Available now' / 'Not covered' rendered as 'Kinachopatikana sasa' / 'kisichokidhiwa' as in-sentence phrases, not the exact coverage.* labels, which are not yet translated; align once they are.

Nothing is saved until you press Record demand. | Hii inafungua fomu fupi: mnunuzi, zao, kiasi, kipindi cha uwasilishaji na bei ya makadirio. Hakuna kinachohifadhiwa hadi ubonyeze Rekodi mahitaji. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Quotes button 'Record demand' as 'Rekodi mahitaji' (demand.create not yet translated).

Below, the screen compares it with the harvest that villages expect in that window. | Zao, kiasi, kipindi cha uwasilishaji na bei ya makadirio — ya makadirio, si nukuu ya bei. Chini yake, skrini inalinganisha hitaji hilo na mavuno ambayo vijiji vinatarajia katika kipindi hicho. | draft | Flag: Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |

It is a comparison — nothing is allocated. Create opportunity, where offered, records a match, not a sale. | Kila kijiji chenye mavuno yanayotarajiwa katika kipindi hicho: kinachopatikana, kiasi cha mahitaji ambacho kinaweza kukidhi, na asilimia ya mahitaji yaliyokidhiwa. Ni ulinganisho tu — hakuna kinachogawiwa. Unda fursa, inapotolewa, inarekodi kwamba mnunuzi amelinganishwa na kijiji, si uuzaji. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Quotes 'Create opportunity' as 'Unda fursa' (demand.createOpportunity not yet translated).

Accepted only means both sides agreed to keep talking — no sale, delivery or payment has happened. | Inarekodi kwamba kijiji hiki kinaweza kumpa mnunuzi huyu mazao, si zaidi. Imekubaliwa inamaanisha tu pande zote mbili zimekubali kuendelea kuzungumza — hakuna uuzaji, uwasilishaji wala malipo uliofanyika. | draft |  |
| `tour.ops.demandOpportunityLinkBody` | Where a village has been matched, its status links to the opportunity. An opportunity records that a village could supply a buyer — it is not a sale, a delivery or a payment. | Kijiji kilipolinganishwa na mnunuzi, hali yake ni kiungo cha fursa. Fursa inarekodi kwamba kijiji kinaweza kumpa mnunuzi mazao — si uuzaji, si uwasilishaji wala malipo. | draft |  |

The offered total is re-added by the database from the supply lines below, so the two can never drift. | Mahitaji ya mnunuzi na kiasi ambacho kijiji hiki kinaweza kutoa, vikiwa tofauti. Jumla inayoweza kutolewa inajumlishwa upya na hifadhidata kutoka kwenye mistari ya ugavi iliyo hapa chini, kwa hiyo hizo mbili haziwezi kupishana kamwe. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Offered' rendered as 'kilichotolewa' / 'kiasi ambacho kijiji hiki kinatoa'; ops label 'Offered' not yet translated.

This is how a headline figure traces back to real records. | Kila mstari unataja mkulima, kipande cha shamba na msimu wa zao nyuma yake, na unaunganisha na rekodi hiyo.

Admin publishes surveys; ops reads the trail. | Kilichofanywa na afisa na mkulima katika onyesho hili kinaonekana kwenye skrini hizi pamoja na majina: rekodi, maombi, majibu ya madodoso na kumbukumbu ya kila vocha. Msimamizi huchapisha madodoso; uendeshaji husoma kumbukumbu. | draft |  |

Verifying cannot be undone, and a household is checked by someone other than the officer who registered it. | Rekodi zilizokusanywa uwandani ambazo bado hakuna aliyezihakiki.

A village peak is not the sum of rated power: the simultaneity factor allows for equipment not all running at once. | Uliopangwa au kulingana na kibao cha mashine — haujapimwa kamwe.

A decision is final and cannot be undone, so the tour never presses these — do it live on a fresh request. | Anza mapitio inahamisha ombi lililowasilishwa hadi hatua ya kupitiwa; kutoka hapo, kila kitufe cha Idhinisha na Kataa kinahitaji maelezo ya maandishi. Uamuzi ni wa mwisho na hauwezi kutenguliwa, kwa hiyo ziara haibonyezi vitufe hivi — fanya hivyo papo hapo kwenye ombi jipya. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Quotes buttons Start review / Approve / Reject as 'Anza mapitio' / 'Idhinisha' / 'Kataa' (ops.startReview etc. not yet in the bundle).

Click a row to open its trail. | Safu moja kwa kila kaya: aliyejibu, lini, hali ya vocha na motisha. Alama ya Imeshikiliwa inamaanisha ni mfanyakazi wa uendeshaji au msimamizi tu anayeweza kuikabidhi, na ilichaguliwa kwa nasibu. Bonyeza safu ili kufungua kumbukumbu zake za ukaguzi. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Held' badge = 'Imeshikiliwa' (glossary: held for audit); 'ops or admin' = uendeshaji au msimamizi (role terms unverified in glossary); 'trail' = kumbukumbu (glossary: kumbukumbu za ukaguzi, unverified).

It is an estimate, not measured consumption, and it stays apart from the prospective figure. | Kilele kilichokadiriwa cha maombi yaliyoamuliwa kuwa ndiyo, kikitumia kigezo cha matumizi ya wakati mmoja.

Every figure is read from the database and drills down to the record it came from. | Uzalishaji, nishati, soko na ubora wa taarifa kwa kijiji kimoja. Kila takwimu inasomwa kutoka kwenye hifadhidata na inaweza kufunguliwa hadi kwenye rekodi ilikotoka. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Data quality' = 'ubora wa taarifa' (no glossary term); 'database' = 'hifadhidata' (standard, unverified). Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |

It is planned, never measured — the tag beside it says so. | Kile ambacho umeme wa kijiji umepangwa kubeba, na msingi ambao kiasi hicho kinategemea.

| `tour.ops.towerMarketBody` | Open buyer demand against the expected harvest that is still available, shown as coverage. Available means not yet committed to an opportunity; it is an estimate, not stock in a store. | Mahitaji ya wanunuzi yaliyo wazi dhidi ya mavuno yanayotarajiwa ambayo bado yanapatikana, yakionyeshwa kama asilimia iliyokidhiwa. Kinachopatikana ni ugavi ambao bado haujaahidiwa kwa fursa; ni makadirio, si akiba iliyo ghalani. | draft | Flag: Drafter: Coverage rendered as 'asilimia iliyokidhiwa' (glossary: yaliyokidhiwa, unverified); 'stock in a store' = 'akiba iliyo ghalani'. |

'See the records' = 'Tazama rekodi', taken from tower.drill (needs the o2 sw label to match). 'not land area' = 'si eneo la ardhi' as a required negation. |
| `tour.ops.towerProductionTableBody` | Each cycle behind the tile: crop, farmer, plot, harvest window, planted area, expected and actual weight. The last row is the figure on the tile, so the headline and its rows visibly match. | Kila msimu wa zao ulio nyuma ya kisanduku: zao, mkulima, kipande cha shamba, kipindi cha kuvuna, eneo lililopandwa, uzito unaotarajiwa na halisi. Safu ya mwisho ni kiasi kilicho kwenye kisanduku, ili kiasi kikuu na safu zake zionekane wazi kuwa zinalingana. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'the headline' = 'kiasi kikuu' (main figure); composed.

Ni ombi, si mzigo, na hakijumlishwi kamwe na kiasi kilichoidhinishwa. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'load' = 'mzigo' (electrical load), plain word, unverified in this sense.

| `tour.ops.towerPueBody` | Requests counted by status, with the indicative catalogue value they represent. Each status opens its requests for this village. Indicative means price times quantity — not a quotation, not financed value. | Maombi yaliyohesabiwa kwa hali, pamoja na thamani ya katalogi ya makadirio yanayowakilisha. Kila hali hufungua maombi yake ya kijiji hiki. Ya makadirio maana yake ni bei mara idadi — si nukuu ya bei, si thamani iliyofadhiliwa. | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'financed value' = 'thamani iliyofadhiliwa kwa mkopo' (composed). 'Indicative' = 'ya makadirio' per glossary decision; 'si nukuu ya bei' kept. Reworded after the cross-check; unreviewed. |

Flag: Drafter: 'Msingi' for basis has no attested sense here; alternative 'kigezo'. Cross-check (low): Category: natural. 'Msingi' was back-translated as 'Foundation (basis)': its attested sense is 'foundation', so 'basis of a capacity figure' may not be understood; the values it labels ('Uliopangwa' / 'Kibao cha mashine') help. 'Kigezo' is the drafter's alternative but is already used for 'simultaneity factor', so a reviewer should decide. |

Cross-check (low): Category: glossary. 'Kiwango kilichokidhiwa' drops 'of demand' and the glossary form 'Mahitaji yaliyokidhiwa (%)'; alone, 'level met' can read as demand fulfilled or delivered, which an opportunity/coverage figure is not. Same wording is used for tower.colCoverage, where it is also much longer than the one-word English header. |

Si thamani iliyofadhiliwa wala si daftari la mikopo. | draft | Prices are INDICATIVE, never quotations. Must not read as a firm offer. Flag: Drafter: 'daftari la mikopo' for loan book is unverified. Cross-check (low): Category: meaning. 'iliyofadhiliwa' (from kufadhili, to sponsor or fund as a donor) may read as grant-funded rather than 'financed' in the loan sense. Finance terms are unresolved in the project, so a reviewer should confirm. The indicative-not-a-quotation reading is intact. |

| `tower.plantedAreaNote` | The sum of cycle areas. Intercropping means several cycles share a plot, so this can exceed the village’s hectares. It is not land area. | Jumla ya maeneo ya misimu ya zao. Kilimo mseto humaanisha misimu kadhaa ya zao inashiriki kipande kimoja cha shamba, kwa hiyo jumla hii inaweza kuzidi hekta za kijiji. Si eneo la ardhi. | draft | This is planted area ACROSS CYCLES, never "land area": intercropping means it can exceed the village’s hectares.

| `tower.prospectivePeak` | Prospective peak | Kilele kinachotarajiwa | draft | Prospective and approved demand are separate figures and are NEVER summed. Flag: Drafter: 'Kilele kinachotarajiwa'/'kilichoidhinishwa' extend existing 'Kilele kilichokadiriwa'; unverified. Cross-check (low): Category: meaning. 'Kilele kinachotarajiwa' (expected peak) suggests a forecast that will happen, whereas English 'prospective' means peaks from submitted or under-review applications that may never be approved. The tower.prospectiveNote ('Ni maombi, si mzigo') mitigates this. The same root is used for 'Expected' harvest, so 'prospective' and 'expected' collapse into one Swahili word. The keep-separate-from-approved rule itself is preserved. |

| `tower.qualityState` | In measure | Katika kipimo | draft | Flag: Drafter: 'Katika kipimo' (in measure) is a literal rendering of 'In measure'; ambiguous, needs check against screen. Cross-check (medium): Category: meaning. 'Katika kipimo' (back: 'In the measure') is opaque, and 'kipimo' elsewhere means 'measurement' (e.g. 'si kipimo'), so it can read as 'measured', which sits badly with the never-measured rule; the English means 'included in this quality metric'. |
