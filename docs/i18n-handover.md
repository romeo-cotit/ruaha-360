# Swahili handover — Ruaha 360

Generated 2026-09-25 from `src/i18n/en/common.json`. Do not edit by hand;
regenerate with `pnpm i18n:handover`.

## What this is

Every user-facing string in the application, for a **native Kiswahili
reviewer** to translate. The string list is frozen: every screen is built,
so the keys will not move while the work is under way.

**Nothing here may be machine translated.** CLAUDE.md is explicit that
machine translation must not be shipped to Tanzanian stakeholders, and the
two strings that already carry Swahili are attested terms rather than
invented product copy. An unreviewed guess is worse than English, because
English is visibly untranslated and a wrong Swahili string is not.

## Priority

- **Required** — the farmer and officer surfaces, and the chrome both of
  them render. 429 strings. CLAUDE.md specifies these ship
  complete Swahili.
- **Optional** — Ops and Tower. 264 strings. These may ship
  English for the demo.

693 strings in total, of which 2 already have Swahili.

## How to read the table

- `{{value}}` and its siblings are placeholders. They must appear in the
  translation exactly as written, or the string will render broken.
- The Notes column carries product requirements from CLAUDE.md, not style
  advice. "Estimate", "indicative" and "planned capacity" are claims about
  what the programme does and does not promise; a translation that
  strengthens them misrepresents it.
- Leave a cell blank rather than guessing, and flag anything whose meaning
  is unclear. A gap is a question; a wrong string is a defect nobody sees.
