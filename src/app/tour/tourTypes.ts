 * contract instead of inventing a parallel one out of class names, which would
 * rot on the next restyle without a single test failing.
 *
 * `route` is where the stop lives. The tour navigates there before showing it,
 * which is what lets a tour explain a whole role rather than one screen. A route
 * with a `$parameter` in it is a screen the tour cannot travel to by itself — a
 * request, a person, a survey — so it is only ever reached by the stop before it
 * opening a row (`open`).
