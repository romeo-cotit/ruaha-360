 * The guided tour, one per surface, in chapters.
 *
 * Runs its short welcome chapter once on a first visit and then stays out of the
 * way; the header keeps a button that opens a menu of chapters, so it can always
 * be asked for again — and asked for at the module in front of you. What counts
 * as "seen" lives in `tourState.ts` — a device convenience, not a column.
 *
 * Joyride is driven in CONTROLLED mode because the tours cross routes: a stop
 * on `/officer/verify` cannot be shown until the router has been there. So the
 * run is held closed at a boundary, the route changes, and the stop resumes
 * once its screen is actually mounted. The alternative — one tour per screen —
 * would describe six screens without ever explaining the job they add up to.
 *
 * Controlled mode also means the library never ENDS a tour by itself: it
 * discards its own index patches when `stepIndex` is supplied, so both of its
 * `→ FINISHED` transitions are unreachable and `status` stays `running`. Every
 * way out is therefore this component's responsibility, and getting one wrong
 * is not cosmetic — the overlay renders for lifecycles the tooltip does not,
 * so a tour that stops advancing without stopping leaves a navy sheet over the
 * page that swallows every click.
