/**
 * The query-key registry from business-rules §10.
 *
 * Not a stub: there is nothing to implement here, only the agreed shape. Every
 * `useQuery` takes its key from this file so that the invalidation map below
 * stays mechanical rather than remembered.
 *
 * Mutations invalidate the NARROWEST key that covers the change.
 *
 * Invalidation map (business-rules §10):
 *
 *   app_register_farmer      people(village), farms(village), tower.all(village)
 *   app_verify               the record key, tower.quality(village),
 *                            and the farmer-facing key for that record
 *   request insert / update  requests(...), request(id), estimate(id),
 *                            tower.energy(village)
 *   approve / reject         as above, plus the farmer's request(id)
 *   app_supersede_harvest    harvest(cycle), tower.production(village),
 *                            tower.market(village)
 *   opportunity_supply write opportunity(id), demand(demandId),
 *                            tower.market(village)
 *   app_farmer_login_issue   loginHistory(person)
 *   app_survey_submit        surveyEligibility, farmerVouchers, voucherTimeline(id)
 *   survey write / publish   surveyAdmin, surveyAdminDetail(id), surveyEligibility
 *   app_voucher_redeem       voucherTimeline(id), surveyVouchers(survey),
 *                            surveySummary, redemptionLog
 *   app_voucher_void         as redeem
